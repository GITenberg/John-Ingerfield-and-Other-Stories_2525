<h2>TO THE GENTLE READER;<br />

TO THE GENTLE CRITIC.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I wrote a little story of a woman who was 
crushed to death by a python.&nbsp; A day or two after its 
publication, a friend stopped me in the street.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Charming little story of yours,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;that about the woman and the snake; but it&rsquo;s not as 
funny as some of your things!&rdquo;&nbsp; The next week, a 
newspaper, referring to the tale, remarked, &ldquo;We have heard 
the incident related before with infinitely greater 
humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this&mdash;and many similar experiences&mdash;in mind, I 
wish distinctly to state that &ldquo;John Ingerfield,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;The Woman of the S&aelig;ter,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Silhouettes,&rdquo; are not intended to be amusing.&nbsp; 
The two other items&mdash;&ldquo;Variety Patter,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;The Lease of the Cross Keys&rdquo;&mdash;I give over to 
the critics of the new humour to rend as they will; but 
&ldquo;John Ingerfield,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Woman of the 
S&aelig;ter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silhouettes,&rdquo; I repeat, I 
should be glad if they would judge from some other standpoint 
than that of humour, new or old.</p>
<h2>IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN INGERFIELD, AND OF ANNE, HIS WIFE<br 
/>
A STORY OF OLD LONDON, IN TWO CHAPTERS</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p>If you take the Underground Railway to Whitechapel Road (the 
East station), and from there take one of the yellow tramcars 
that start from that point, and go down the Commercial Road, past
the George, in front of which starts&mdash;or used to 
stand&mdash;a high flagstaff, at the base of which sits&mdash;or 
used to sit&mdash;an elderly female purveyor of pigs&rsquo; 
trotters at three-ha&rsquo;pence apiece, until you come to where 
a railway arch crosses the road obliquely, and there get down and
turn to the right up a narrow, noisy street leading to the river,
and then to the right again up a still narrower street, which you
may know by its having a public-house at one corner (as is in the
nature of things) and a marine store-dealer&rsquo;s at the other,
outside which strangely stiff and unaccommodating garments of 
gigantic size flutter ghost-like in the wind, you will come to a 
dingy railed-in churchyard, surrounded on all sides by cheerless,
many-peopled houses.&nbsp; Sad-looking little old houses they 
are, in spite of the tumult of life about their ever open 
doors.&nbsp; They and the ancient church in their midst seem 
weary of the ceaseless jangle around them.&nbsp; Perhaps, 
standing there for so many years, listening to the long silence 
of the dead, the fretful voices of the living sound foolish in 
their ears.</p>
<p>Peering through the railings on the side nearest the river, 
you will see beneath the shadow of the soot-grimed church&rsquo;s
soot-grimed porch&mdash;that is, if the sun happen, by rare 
chance, to be strong enough to cast any shadow at all in that 
region of grey light&mdash;a curiously high and narrow headstone 
that once was white and straight, not tottering and bent with age
as it is now.&nbsp; There is upon this stone a carving in 
bas-relief, as you will see for yourself if you will make your 
way to it through the gateway on the opposite side of the 
square.&nbsp; It represents, so far as can be made out, for it is
much worn by time and dirt, a figure lying on the ground with 
another figure bending over it, while at a little distance stands
a third object.&nbsp; But this last is so indistinct that it 
might be almost anything, from an angel to a post.</p>
<p>And below the carving are the words (already half obliterated)
that I have used for the title of this story.</p>
<p>Should you ever wander of a Sunday morning within sound of the
cracked bell that calls a few habit-bound, old-fashioned folk to 
worship within those damp-stained walls, and drop into talk with 
the old men who on such days sometimes sit, each in his 
brass-buttoned long brown coat, upon the low stone coping 
underneath those broken railings, you might hear this tale from 
them, as I did, more years ago than I care to recollect.</p>
<p>But lest you do not choose to go to all this trouble, or lest 
the old men who could tell it you have grown tired of all talk, 
and are not to be roused ever again into the telling of tales, 
and you yet wish for the story, I will here set it down for 
you.</p>
<p>But I cannot recount it to you as they told it to me, for to 
me it was only a tale that I heard and remembered, thinking to 
tell it again for profit, while to them it was a thing that had 
been, and the threads of it were interwoven with the woof of 
their own life.&nbsp; As they talked, faces that I did not see 
passed by among the crowd and turned and looked at them, and 
voices that I did not hear spoke to them below the clamour of the
street, so that through their thin piping voices there quivered 
the deep music of life and death, and my tale must be to theirs 
but as a gossip&rsquo;s chatter to the story of him whose breast 
has felt the press of battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>John Ingerfield, oil and tallow refiner, of Lavender Wharf, 
Limehouse, comes of a hard-headed, hard-fisted stock.&nbsp; The 
first of the race that the eye of Record, piercing the deepening 
mists upon the centuries behind her, is able to discern with any 
clearness is a long-haired, sea-bronzed personage, whom men call 
variously Inge or Unger.&nbsp; Out of the wild North Sea he has 
come.&nbsp; Record observes him, one of a small, fierce group, 
standing on the sands of desolate Northumbria, staring landward, 
his worldly wealth upon his back.&nbsp; This consists of a 
two-handed battle-axe, value perhaps some forty stycas in the 
currency of the time.&nbsp; A careful man, with business 
capabilities, may, however, manipulate a small capital to great 
advantage.&nbsp; In what would appear, to those accustomed to our
slow modern methods, an incredibly short space of time, 
Inge&rsquo;s two-handed battle-axe has developed into wide lands 
and many head of cattle; which latter continue to multiply with a
rapidity beyond the dreams of present-day breeders.&nbsp; 
Inge&rsquo;s descendants would seem to have inherited the genius 
of their ancestor, for they prosper and their worldly goods 
increase.&nbsp; They are a money-making race.&nbsp; In all times,
out of all things, by all means, they make money.&nbsp; They 
fight for money, marry for money, live for money, are ready to 
die for money.</p>
<p>In the days when the most saleable and the highest priced 
article in the markets of Europe was a strong arm and a cool 
head, then each Ingerfield (as &ldquo;Inge,&rdquo; long rooted in
Yorkshire soil, had grown or been corrupted to) was a soldier of 
fortune, and offered his strong arm and his cool head to the 
highest bidder.&nbsp; They fought for their price, and they took 
good care that they obtained their price; but, the price settled,
they fought well, for they were staunch men and true, according 
to their lights, though these lights may have been placed 
somewhat low down, near the earth.</p>
<p>Then followed the days when the chief riches of the world lay 
tossed for daring hands to grasp upon the bosom of the sea, and 
the sleeping spirit of the old Norse Rover stirred in their 
veins, and the lilt of a wild sea-song they had never heard kept 
ringing in their ears; and they built them ships and sailed for 
the Spanish Main, and won much wealth, as was their wont.</p>
<p>Later on, when Civilisation began to lay down and enforce 
sterner rules for the game of life, and peaceful methods promised
to prove more profitable than violent, the Ingerfields became 
traders and merchants of grave mien and sober life; for their 
ambition from generation to generation remains ever the same, 
their various callings being but means to an end.</p>
<p>A hard, stern race of men they would seem to have been, but 
just&mdash;so far as they understood justice.&nbsp; They have the
reputation of having been good husbands, fathers, and masters; 
but one cannot help thinking of them as more respected than 
loved.</p>
<p>They were men to exact the uttermost farthing due to them, yet
not without a sense of the thing due from them, their own duty 
and responsibility&mdash;nay, not altogether without their 
moments of heroism, which is the duty of great men.&nbsp; History
relates how a certain Captain Ingerfield, returning with much 
treasure from the West Indies&mdash;how acquired it were, 
perhaps, best not to inquire too closely&mdash;is overhauled upon
the high seas by King&rsquo;s frigate.&nbsp; Captain of 
King&rsquo;s frigate sends polite message to Captain Ingerfield 
requesting him to be so kind as to promptly hand over a certain 
member of his ship&rsquo;s company, who, by some means or 
another, has made himself objectionable to King&rsquo;s friends, 
in order that he (the said objectionable person) may be forthwith
hanged from the yard-arm.</p>
<p>Captain Ingerfield returns polite answer to Captain of 
King&rsquo;s frigate that he (Captain Ingerfield) will, with much
pleasure, hang any member of his ship&rsquo;s company that needs 
hanging, but that neither the King of England nor any one else on
God Almighty&rsquo;s sea is going to do it for him.&nbsp; Captain
of King&rsquo;s frigate sends back word that if objectionable 
person be not at once given up he shall be compelled with much 
regret to send Ingerfield and his ship to the bottom of the 
Atlantic.&nbsp; Replies Captain Ingerfield, &ldquo;That is just 
what he will have to do before I give up one of my people,&rdquo;
and fights the big frigate&mdash;fights it so fiercely that after
three hours Captain of King&rsquo;s frigate thinks it will be 
good to try argument again, and sends therefore a further 
message, courteously acknowledging Captain Ingerfield&rsquo;s 
courage and skill, and suggesting that, he having done sufficient
to vindicate his honour and renown, it would be politic to now 
hand over the unimportant cause of contention, and so escape with
his treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your Captain,&rdquo; shouts back this Ingerfield, 
who has discovered there are sweeter things to fight for than 
even money, &ldquo;that the <i>Wild Goose</i> has flown the seas 
with her belly full of treasure before now, and will, if it be 
God&rsquo;s pleasure, so do again, but that master and man in her
sail together, fight together, and die together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon King&rsquo;s frigate pounds away more vigorously 
than ever, and succeeds eventually in carrying out her 
threat.&nbsp; Down goes the <i>Wild Goose</i>, her last chase 
ended&mdash;down she goes with a plunge, spit foremost with her 
colours flying; and down with her goes every man left standing on
her decks; and at the bottom of the Atlantic they lie to this 
day, master and man side by side, keeping guard upon their 
treasure.</p>
<p>Which incident, and it is well authenticated, goes far to 
prove that the Ingerfields, hard men and grasping men though they
be&mdash;men caring more for the getting of money than for the 
getting of love&mdash;loving more the cold grip of gold than the 
grip of kith or kin, yet bear buried in their hearts the seeds of
a nobler manhood, for which, however, the barren soil of their 
ambition affords scant nourishment.</p>
<p>The John Ingerfield of this story is a man very typical of his
race.&nbsp; He has discovered that the oil and tallow refining 
business, though not a pleasant one, is an exceedingly lucrative 
one.&nbsp; These are the good days when George the Third is king,
and London is rapidly becoming a city of bright night.&nbsp; 
Tallow and oil and all materials akin thereto are in ever-growing
request, and young John Ingerfield builds himself a large 
refining house and warehouse in the growing suburb of Limehouse, 
which lies between the teeming river and the quiet fields, 
gathers many people round about him, puts his strong heart into 
his work, and prospers.</p>
<p>All the days of his youth he labours and garners, and lays out
and garners yet again.&nbsp; In early middle age he finds himself
a wealthy man.&nbsp; The chief business of life, the getting of 
money, is practically done; his enterprise is firmly established,
and will continue to grow with ever less need of husbandry.&nbsp;
It is time for him to think about the secondary business of life,
the getting together of a wife and home, for the Ingerfields have
ever been good citizens, worthy heads of families, openhanded 
hosts, making a brave show among friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>John Ingerfield, sitting in his stiff, high-backed chair, in 
his stiffly, but solidly, furnished dining-room, above his 
counting-house, sipping slowly his one glass of port, takes 
counsel with himself.</p>
<p>What shall she be?</p>
<p>He is rich, and can afford a good article.&nbsp; She must be 
young and handsome, fit to grace the fine house he will take for 
her in fashionable Bloomsbury, far from the odour and touch of 
oil and tallow.&nbsp; She must be well bred, with a gracious, 
noble manner, that will charm his guests and reflect honour and 
credit upon himself; she must, above all, be of good family, with
a genealogical tree sufficiently umbrageous to hide Lavender 
Wharf from the eyes of Society.</p>
<p>What else she may or may not be he does not very much 
care.&nbsp; She will, of course, be virtuous and moderately 
pious, as it is fit and proper that women should be.&nbsp; It 
will also be well that her disposition be gentle and yielding, 
but that is of minor importance, at all events so far as he is 
concerned: the Ingerfield husbands are not the class of men upon 
whom wives vent their tempers.</p>
<p>Having decided in his mind <i>what</i> she shall be, he 
proceeds to discuss with himself <i>who</i> she shall be.&nbsp; 
His social circle is small.&nbsp; Methodically, in thought, he 
makes the entire round of it, mentally scrutinising every maiden 
that he knows.&nbsp; Some are charming, some are fair, some are 
rich; but no one of them approaches near to his carefully 
considered ideal.</p>
<p>He keeps the subject in his mind, and muses on it in the 
intervals of business.&nbsp; At odd moments he jots down names as
they occur to him upon a slip of paper, which he pins for the 
purpose on the inside of the cover of his desk.&nbsp; He arranges
them alphabetically, and when it is as complete as his memory can
make it, he goes critically down the list, making a few notes 
against each.&nbsp; As a result, it becomes clear to him that he 
must seek among strangers for his wife.</p>
<p>He has a friend, or rather an acquaintance, an old 
school-fellow, who has developed into one of those curious social
flies that in all ages are to be met with buzzing contentedly 
within the most exclusive circles, and concerning whom, seeing 
that they are neither rare nor rich, nor extraordinarily clever 
nor well born, one wonders &ldquo;how the devil they got 
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; Meeting this man by chance one afternoon, he 
links his arm in his and invites him home to dinner.</p>
<p>So soon as they are left alone, with the walnuts and wine 
between them, John Ingerfield says, thoughtfully cracking a hard 
nut between his fingers&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will, I&rsquo;m going to get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent idea&mdash;delighted to hear it, I&rsquo;m 
sure,&rdquo; replies Will, somewhat less interested in the 
information than in the delicately flavoured Madeira he is 
lovingly sipping.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet,&rdquo; is John 
Ingerfield&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>His friend glances slyly at him over his glass, not sure 
whether he is expected to be amused or sympathetically 
helpful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to find one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will Cathcart puts down his glass and stares at his host 
across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be delighted to help you, Jack,&rdquo; he 
stammers, in an alarmed tone&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;pon my soul I 
should; but really don&rsquo;t know a damned woman I could 
recommend&mdash;&rsquo;pon my soul I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must see a good many: I wish you&rsquo;d look out 
for one that you <i>could</i> recommend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will, my dear Jack!&rdquo; answers the 
other, in a relieved voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never thought about 
&rsquo;em in that way before.&nbsp; Daresay I shall come across 
the very girl to suit you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open and
let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be obliged to you if you will,&rdquo; replies 
John Ingerfield, quietly; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s your turn, I 
think, to oblige me, Will.&nbsp; I have obliged you, if you 
recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall never forget it, my dear Jack,&rdquo; murmurs 
Will, a little uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was uncommonly good of 
you.&nbsp; You saved me from ruin, Jack: shall think about it to 
my dying day&mdash;&rsquo;pon my soul I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to let it worry you for so long a period as 
that,&rdquo; returns John, with the faintest suspicion of a smile
playing round his firm mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bill falls due at 
the end of next month.&nbsp; You can discharge the debt then, and
the matter will be off your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will finds his chair growing uncomfortable under him, while 
the Madeira somehow loses its flavour.&nbsp; He gives a short, 
nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;so soon as that?&nbsp; 
The date had quite slipped my memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunate that I reminded you,&rdquo; says John, the 
smile round his lips deepening.</p>
<p>Will fidgets on his seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, my 
dear Jack,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I shall have to get you to 
renew it, just for a month or two,&mdash;deuced awkward thing, 
but I&rsquo;m remarkably short of money this year.&nbsp; Truth 
is, I can&rsquo;t get what&rsquo;s owing to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very awkward, certainly,&rdquo; replies 
his friend, &ldquo;because I am not at all sure that I shall be 
able to renew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will stares at him in some alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what am I 
to do if I hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Ingerfield shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean, my dear Jack, that you would put 
me in prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Other people have to go there who 
can&rsquo;t pay their debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will Cathcart&rsquo;s alarm grows to serious 
proportions.&nbsp; &ldquo;But our friendship,&rdquo; he cries, 
&ldquo;our&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Will,&rdquo; interrupts the other, &ldquo;there
are few friends I would lend three hundred pounds to and make no 
effort to get it back.&nbsp; You, certainly, are not one of 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make a bargain,&rdquo; he continues.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Find me a wife, and on the day of my marriage I will send 
you back that bill with, perhaps, a couple of hundred 
added.&nbsp; If by the end of next month you have not introduced 
me to a lady fit to be, and willing to be, Mrs. John Ingerfield, 
I shall decline to renew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Ingerfield refills his own glass and hospitably pushes 
the bottle towards his guest&mdash;who, however, contrary to his 
custom, takes no notice of it, but stares hard at his 
shoe-buckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he says at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite serious,&rdquo; is the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
want to marry.&nbsp; My wife must be a lady by birth and 
education.&nbsp; She must be of good family&mdash;of family 
sufficiently good, indeed, to compensate for the refinery.&nbsp; 
She must be young and beautiful and charming.&nbsp; I am purely a
business man.&nbsp; I want a woman capable of conducting the 
social department of my life.&nbsp; I know of no such lady 
myself.&nbsp; I appeal to you, because you, I know, are intimate 
with the class among whom she must be sought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be some difficulty in persuading a lady of 
the required qualifications to accept the situation,&rdquo; says 
Cathcart, with a touch of malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to find one who will,&rdquo; says John 
Ingerfield.</p>
<p>Early in the evening Will Cathcart takes leave of his host, 
and departs thoughtful and anxious; and John Ingerfield strolls 
contemplatively up and down his wharf, for the smell of oil and 
tallow has grown to be very sweet to him, and it is pleasant to 
watch the moonbeams shining on the piled-up casks.</p>
<p>Six weeks go by.&nbsp; On the first day of the seventh John 
takes Will Cathcart&rsquo;s acceptance from its place in the 
large safe, and lays it in the smaller box beside his desk, 
devoted to more pressing and immediate business.&nbsp; Two days 
later Cathcart picks his way across the slimy yard, passes 
through the counting-house, and enters his friend&rsquo;s inner 
sanctum, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>He wears a jubilant air, and slaps the grave John on the 
back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got her, Jack,&rdquo; he 
cries.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been hard work, I can tell you: 
sounding suspicious old dowagers, bribing confidential servants, 
fishing for information among friends of the family.&nbsp; By 
Jove, I shall be able to join the Duke&rsquo;s staff as 
spy-in-chief to His Majesty&rsquo;s entire forces after 
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo; asks John, without stopping 
his writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like!&nbsp; My dear Jack, you&rsquo;ll fall over head 
and ears in love with her the moment you see her.&nbsp; A little 
cold, perhaps, but that will just suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good family?&rdquo; asks John, signing and folding the 
letter he has finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So good that I was afraid at first it would be useless 
thinking of her.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s a sensible girl, no 
confounded nonsense about her, and the family are poor as church 
mice.&nbsp; In fact&mdash;well, to tell the truth, we have become
most excellent friends, and she told me herself frankly that she 
meant to marry a rich man, and didn&rsquo;t much care 
whom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds hopeful,&rdquo; remarks the would-be 
bridegroom, with his peculiar dry smile: &ldquo;when shall I have
the pleasure of seeing her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come with me to-night to the 
Garden,&rdquo; replies the other; &ldquo;she will be in Lady 
Heatherington&rsquo;s box, and I will introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that evening John Ingerfield goes to Covent Garden Theatre,
with the blood running a trifle quicker in his veins, but not 
much, than would be the case were he going to the docks to 
purchase tallow&mdash;examines, covertly, the proposed article 
from the opposite side of the house, and approves her&mdash;is 
introduced to her, and, on closer inspection, approves her still 
more&mdash;receives an invitation to visit&mdash;visits 
frequently, and each time is more satisfied of the rarity, 
serviceableness, and quality of the article.</p>
<p>If all John Ingerfield requires for a wife is a beautiful 
social machine, surely here he has found his ideal.&nbsp; Anne 
Singleton, only daughter of that persistently unfortunate but 
most charming of baronets, Sir Harry Singleton (more charming, it
is rumoured, outside his family circle than within it), is a 
stately graceful, high-bred woman.&nbsp; Her portrait, by 
Reynolds, still to be seen above the carved wainscoting of one of
the old City halls, shows a wonderfully handsome and clever face,
but at the same time a wonderfully cold and heartless one.&nbsp; 
It is the face of a woman half weary of, half sneering at the 
world.&nbsp; One reads in old family letters, whereof the ink is 
now very faded and the paper very yellow, long criticisms of this
portrait.&nbsp; The writers complain that if the picture is at 
all like her she must have greatly changed since her girlhood, 
for they remember her then as having a laughing and winsome 
expression.</p>
<p>They say&mdash;they who knew her in after-life&mdash;that this
earlier face came back to her in the end, so that the many who 
remembered opening their eyes and seeing her bending down over 
them could never recognise the portrait of the beautiful sneering
lady, even when they were told whom it represented.</p>
<p>But at the time of John Ingerfield&rsquo;s strange wooing she 
was the Anne Singleton of Sir Joshua&rsquo;s portrait, and John 
Ingerfield liked her the better that she was.</p>
<p>He had no feeling of sentiment in the matter himself, and it 
simplified the case that she had none either.&nbsp; He offered 
her a plain bargain, and she accepted it.&nbsp; For all he knew 
or cared, her attitude towards this subject of marriage was the 
usual one assumed by women.&nbsp; Very young girls had their 
heads full of romantic ideas.&nbsp; It was better for her and for
him that she had got rid of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours will be a union founded on good sense,&rdquo; said
John Ingerfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope the experiment will succeed,&rdquo; said 
Anne Singleton.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>But the experiment does not succeed.&nbsp; The laws of God 
decree that man shall purchase woman, that woman shall give 
herself to man, for other coin than that of good sense.&nbsp; 
Good sense is not a legal tender in the marriage mart.&nbsp; Men 
and women who enter therein with only sense in their purse have 
no right to complain if, on reaching home, they find they have 
concluded an unsatisfactory bargain.</p>
<p>John Ingerfield, when he asked Anne Singleton to be his wife, 
felt no more love for her than he felt for any of the other 
sumptuous household appointments he was purchasing about the same
time, and made no pretence of doing so.&nbsp; Nor, had he done 
so, would she have believed him; for Anne Singleton has learned 
much in her twenty-two summers and winters, and knows that love 
is only a meteor in life&rsquo;s sky, and that the true lodestar 
of this world is gold.&nbsp; Anne Singleton has had her romance 
and buried it deep down in her deep nature and over its grave, to
keep its ghost from rising, has piled the stones of indifference 
and contempt, as many a woman has done before and since.&nbsp; 
Once upon a time Anne Singleton sat dreaming out a story.&nbsp; 
It was a story old as the hills&mdash;older than some of 
them&mdash;but to her, then, it was quite new and very 
wonderful.&nbsp; It contained all the usual stock material common
to such stories: the lad and the lass, the plighted troth, the 
richer suitors, the angry parents, the love that was worth 
braving all the world for.&nbsp; One day into this dream there 
fell from the land of the waking a letter, a poor, pitiful 
letter: &ldquo;You know I love you and only you,&rdquo; it ran; 
&ldquo;my heart will always be yours till I die.&nbsp; But my 
father threatens to stop my allowance, and, as you know, I have 
nothing of my own except debts.&nbsp; Some would call her 
handsome, but how can I think of her beside you?&nbsp; Oh, why 
was money ever let to come into the world to curse us?&rdquo; 
with many other puzzling questions of a like character, and much 
severe condemnation of Fate and Heaven and other parties 
generally, and much self-commiseration.</p>
<p>Anne Singleton took long to read the letter.&nbsp; When she 
had finished it, and had read it through again, she rose, and, 
crushing it her hand, flung it in the fire with a laugh, and as 
the flame burnt up and died away felt that her life had died with
it, not knowing that bruised hearts can heal.</p>
<p>So when John Ingerfield comes wooing, and speaks to her no 
word of love but only of money, she feels that here at last is a 
genuine voice that she can trust.&nbsp; Love of the lesser side 
of life is still left to her.&nbsp; It will be pleasant to be the
wealthy mistress of a fine house, to give great receptions, to 
exchange the secret poverty of home for display and luxury.&nbsp;
These things are offered to her on the very terms she would have 
suggested herself.&nbsp; Accompanied by love she would have 
refused them, knowing she could give none in return.</p>
<p>But a woman finds it one thing not to desire affection and 
another thing not to possess it.&nbsp; Day by day the atmosphere 
of the fine house in Bloomsbury grows cold and colder about her 
heart.&nbsp; Guests warm it at times for a few hours, then 
depart, leaving it chillier than before.</p>
<p>For her husband she attempts to feel indifference, but living 
creatures joined together cannot feel indifference for each 
other.&nbsp; Even two dogs in a leash are compelled to think of 
one another.&nbsp; A man and wife must love or hate, like or 
dislike, in degree as the bond connecting them is drawn tight or 
allowed to hang slack.&nbsp; By mutual desire their chains of 
wedlock have been fastened as loosely as respect for security 
will permit, with the happy consequence that her aversion to him 
does not obtrude itself beyond the limits of politeness.</p>
<p>Her part of the contract she faithfully fulfils, for the 
Singletons also have their code of honour.&nbsp; Her beauty, her 
tact, her charm, her influence, are devoted to his 
service&mdash;to the advancement of his position, the furtherance
of his ambition.&nbsp; Doors that would otherwise remain closed 
she opens to him.&nbsp; Society, that would otherwise pass by 
with a sneer, sits round his table.&nbsp; His wishes and 
pleasures are hers.&nbsp; In all things she yields him wifely 
duty, seeks to render herself agreeable to him, suffers in 
silence his occasional caresses.&nbsp; Whatever was implied in 
the bargain, that she will perform to the letter.</p>
<p>He, on his side, likewise performs his part with businesslike 
conscientiousness&mdash;nay, seeing that the pleasing of her 
brings no personal gratification to himself&mdash;not without 
generosity.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is ever thoughtful of and deferential 
to her, awarding her at all times an unvarying courteousness that
is none the less sincere for being studied.&nbsp; Her every 
expressed want is gratified, her every known distaste 
respected.&nbsp; Conscious of his presence being an oppression to
her, he is even careful not to intrude it upon her oftener than 
is necessary.</p>
<p>At times he asks himself, somewhat pertinently, what he has 
gained by marriage&mdash;wonders whether this social race was 
quite the most interesting game he could have elected to occupy 
his leisure&mdash;wonders whether, after all, he would not have 
been happier over his counting-house than in these sumptuous, 
glittering rooms, where he always seems, and feels himself to be,
the uninvited guest.</p>
<p>The only feeling that a closer intimacy has created in him for
his wife is that of indulgent contempt.&nbsp; As there is no 
equality between man and woman, so there can be no respect.&nbsp;
She is a different being.&nbsp; He must either look up to her as 
superior to himself, or down upon her as inferior.&nbsp; When a 
man does the former he is more or less in love, and love to John 
Ingerfield is an unknown emotion.&nbsp; Her beauty, her charm, 
her social tact&mdash;even while he makes use of them for his own
purposes, he despises as the weapons of a weak nature.</p>
<p>So in their big, cold mansion John Ingerfield and Anne, his 
wife, sit far apart, strangers to one another, neither desiring 
to know the other nearer.</p>
<p>About his business he never speaks to her, and she never 
questions him.&nbsp; To compensate for the slight shrinkage of 
time he is able to devote to it, he becomes more strict and 
exacting; grows a harsher master to his people, a sterner 
creditor, a greedier dealer, squeezing the uttermost out of every
one, feverish to grow richer, so that he may spend more upon the 
game that day by day he finds more tiresome and 
uninteresting.</p>
<p>And the piled-up casks upon his wharves increase and multiply;
and on the dirty river his ships and barges lie in 
ever-lengthening lines; and round his greasy cauldrons sweating, 
witch-like creatures swarm in ever-denser numbers, stirring oil 
and tallow into gold.</p>
<p>Until one summer, from its nest in the far East, there 
flutters westward a foul thing.&nbsp; Hovering over Limehouse 
suburb, seeing it crowded and unclean, liking its fetid smell, it
settles down upon it.</p>
<p>Typhus is the creature&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; At first it lurks 
there unnoticed, battening upon the rich, rank food it finds 
around it, until, grown too big to hide longer, it boldly shows 
its hideous head, and the white face of Terror runs swiftly 
through alley and street, crying as it runs, forces itself into 
John Ingerfield&rsquo;s counting-house, and tells its 
tale.&nbsp;&nbsp; John Ingerfield sits for a while 
thinking.&nbsp; Then he mounts his horse and rides home at as 
hard a pace as the condition of the streets will allow.&nbsp; In 
the hall he meets Anne going out, and stops her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come too near me,&rdquo; he says 
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Typhus fever has broken out at Limehouse, 
and they say one can communicate it, even without having it 
oneself.&nbsp; You had better leave London for a few weeks.&nbsp;
Go down to your father&rsquo;s: I will come and fetch you when it
is all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passes her, giving her a wide berth, and goes upstairs, 
where he remains for some minutes in conversation with his 
valet.&nbsp; Then, coming down, he remounts and rides off 
again.</p>
<p>After a little while Anne goes up into his room.&nbsp; His man
is kneeling in the middle of the floor, packing a valise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you to take it?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to the wharf, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answers the man:
&ldquo;Mr. Ingerfield is going to be there for a day or 
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Anne sits in the great empty drawing-room, and takes 
<i>her</i> turn at thinking.</p>
<p>John Ingerfield finds, on his return to Limehouse, that the 
evil has greatly increased during the short time he has been 
away.&nbsp; Fanned by fear and ignorance, fed by poverty and 
dirt, the scourge is spreading through the district like a 
fire.&nbsp; Long smouldering in secret, it has now burst forth at
fifty different points at once.&nbsp; Not a street, not a court 
but has its &ldquo;case.&rdquo;&nbsp; Over a dozen of 
John&rsquo;s hands are down with it already.&nbsp; Two more have 
sunk prostrate beside their work within the last hour.&nbsp; The 
panic grows grotesque.&nbsp; Men and women tear their clothes 
off, looking to see if they have anywhere upon them a rash or a 
patch of mottled skin, find that they have, or imagine that they 
have, and rush, screaming, half-undressed, into the street.&nbsp;
Two men, meeting in a narrow passage, both rush back, too 
frightened to pass each other.&nbsp; A boy stoops down and 
scratches his leg&mdash;not an action that under ordinary 
circumstances would excite much surprise in that 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In an instant there is a wild stampede from 
the room, the strong trampling on the weak in their eagerness to 
escape.</p>
<p>These are not the days of organised defence against 
disease.&nbsp; There are kind hearts and willing hands in London 
town, but they are not yet closely enough banded together to meet
a swift foe such as this.&nbsp; There are hospitals and charities
galore, but these are mostly in the City, maintained by the City 
Fathers for the exclusive benefit of poor citizens and members of
the guilds.&nbsp; The few free hospitals are already over-crowded
and ill-prepared.&nbsp; Squalid, outlying Limehouse, belonging to
nowhere, cared for by nobody, must fight for itself.</p>
<p>John Ingerfield calls the older men together, and with their 
help attempts to instil some sense and reason into his terrified 
people.&nbsp; Standing on the step of his counting-house, and 
addressing as many of them as are not too scared to listen, he 
tells them of the danger of fear and of the necessity for 
calmness and courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must face and fight this thing like men,&rdquo; he 
cries, in that deep, din-conquering voice that has served the 
Ingerfields in good stead on many a steel-swept field, on many a 
storm-struck sea; &ldquo;there must be no cowardly selfishness, 
no faint-hearted despair.&nbsp; If we&rsquo;ve got to die 
we&rsquo;ll die; but please God we&rsquo;ll live.&nbsp; Anyhow, 
we will stick together, and help each other.&nbsp; I mean to stop
here with you, and do what I can for you.&nbsp; None of my people
shall want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Ingerfield ceases, and as the vibrations of his strong 
tones roll away a sweet voice from beside him rises clear and 
firm:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come down to be with you also, and to help my 
husband.&nbsp; I shall take charge of the nursing and tending of 
your sick, and I hope I shall be of some real use to you.&nbsp; 
My husband and I are so sorry for you in your trouble.&nbsp; I 
know you will be brave and patient.&nbsp; We will all do our 
best, and be hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turns, half expecting to see only the empty air and to 
wonder at the delirium in his brain.&nbsp; She puts her hand in 
his, and their eyes meet; and in that moment, for the first time 
in their lives, these two see one another.</p>
<p>They speak no word.&nbsp; There is no opportunity for 
words.&nbsp; There is work to be done, and done quickly, and Anne
grasps it with the greed of a woman long hungry for the joy of 
doing.&nbsp; As John watches her moving swiftly and quietly 
through the bewildered throng, questioning, comforting, gently 
compelling, the thought comes to him, Ought he to allow her to be
here, risking her life for his people? followed by the thought, 
How is he going to prevent it?&nbsp; For in this hour the 
knowledge is born within him that Anne is not his property; that 
he and she are fellow hands taking their orders from the same 
Master; that though it be well for them to work together and help
each other, they must not hinder one another.</p>
<p>As yet John does not understand all this.&nbsp; The idea is 
new and strange to him.&nbsp; He feels as the child in a fairy 
story on suddenly discovering that the trees and flowers has he 
passed by carelessly a thousand times can think and talk.&nbsp; 
Once he whispers to her of the labour and the danger, but she 
answers simply, &ldquo;They are my people too, John: it is my 
work&rdquo;; and he lets her have her way.</p>
<p>Anne has a true woman&rsquo;s instinct for nursing, and her 
strong sense stands her in stead of experience.&nbsp; A glance 
into one or two of the squalid dens where these people live tells
her that if her patients are to be saved they must be nursed away
from their own homes; and she determines to convert the large 
counting-house&mdash;a long, lofty room at the opposite end of 
the wharf to the refinery&mdash;into a temporary hospital.&nbsp; 
Selecting some seven or eight of the most reliable women to 
assist her, she proceeds to prepare it for its purpose.&nbsp; 
Ledgers might be volumes of poetry, bills of lading mere street 
ballads, for all the respect that is shown to them.&nbsp; The 
older clerks stand staring aghast, feeling that the end of all 
things is surely at hand, and that the universe is rushing down 
into space, until, their idleness being detected, they are 
themselves promptly impressed for the sacrilegious work, and made
to assist in the demolition of their own temple.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s commands are spoken very sweetly, and are 
accompanied by the sweetest of smiles; but they are nevertheless 
commands, and somehow it does not occur to any one to disobey 
them.&nbsp; John&mdash;stern, masterful, authoritative John, who 
has never been approached with anything more dictatorial than a 
timid request since he left Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School 
nineteen years ago, who would have thought that something had 
suddenly gone wrong with the laws of Nature if he had 
been&mdash;finds himself hurrying along the street on his way to 
a druggist&rsquo;s shop, slackens his pace an instant to ask 
himself why and wherefore he is doing so, recollects that he was 
told to do so and to make haste back, marvels who could have 
dared to tell him to do anything and to make haste back, 
remembers that it was Anne, is not quite sure what to think about
it, but hurries on.&nbsp; He &ldquo;makes haste back,&rdquo; is 
praised for having been so quick, and feels pleased with himself;
is sent off again in another direction, with instructions what to
say when he gets there.&nbsp; He starts off (he is becoming used 
to being ordered about now).&nbsp; Halfway there great alarm 
seizes him, for on attempting to say over the message to himself,
to be sure that he has it quite right, he discovers he has 
forgotten it.&nbsp; He pauses, nervous and excited; cogitates as 
to whether it will be safe for him to concoct a message of his 
own, weighs anxiously the chances&mdash;supposing that he does 
so&mdash;of being found out.&nbsp; Suddenly, to his intense 
surprise and relief, every word of what he was told to say comes 
back to him; and he hastens on, repeating it over and over to 
himself as he walks, lest it should escape him again.</p>
<p>And then a few hundred yards farther on there occurs one of 
the most extraordinary events that has ever happened in that 
street before or since: John Ingerfield laughs.</p>
<p>John Ingerfield, of Lavender Wharf, after walking two-thirds 
of Creek Lane, muttering to himself with his eyes on the ground, 
stops in the middle of the road and laughs; and one small boy, 
who tells the story to his dying day, sees him and hears him, and
runs home at the top of his speed with the wonderful news, and is
conscientiously slapped by his mother for telling lies.</p>
<p>All that day Anne works like a heroine, John helping her, and 
occasionally getting in the way.&nbsp; By night she has her 
little hospital prepared and three beds already up and occupied; 
and, all now done that can be done, she and John go upstairs to 
his old rooms above the counting-house.</p>
<p>John ushers her into them with some misgiving, for by contrast
with the house at Bloomsbury they are poor and shabby.&nbsp; He 
places her in the arm-chair near the fire, begging her to rest 
quiet, and then assists his old housekeeper, whose wits, never of
the strongest, have been scared by the day&rsquo;s proceeding, to
lay the meal.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s eyes follow him as he moves about the room.&nbsp;
Perhaps here, where all the real part of his life has been 
passed, he is more his true self than amid the unfamiliar 
surroundings of fashion; perhaps this simpler frame shows him to 
greater advantage; but Anne wonders how it is she has never 
noticed before that he is a well-set, handsome man.&nbsp; Nor, 
indeed, is he so very old-looking.&nbsp; Is it a trick of the dim
light, or what?&nbsp; He looks almost young.&nbsp; But why should
he not look young, seeing he is only thirty-six, and at 
thirty-six a man is in his prime?&nbsp; Anne wonders why she has 
always thought of him as an elderly person.</p>
<p>A portrait of one of John&rsquo;s ancestors hangs over the 
great mantelpiece&mdash;of that sturdy Captain Ingerfield who 
fought the King&rsquo;s frigate rather than give up one of his 
people.&nbsp; Anne glances from the dead face to the living and 
notes the strong likeness between them.&nbsp; Through her 
half-closed eyes she sees the grim old captain hurling back his 
message of defiance, and his face is the face she saw a few hours
ago, saying, &ldquo;I mean to stop here with you and do what I 
can for you.&nbsp; None of my people shall want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John is placing a chair for her at the table, and the light 
from the candles falls upon him.&nbsp; She steals another glance 
at his face&mdash;a strong, stern, handsome face, capable of 
becoming a noble face.&nbsp; Anne wonders if it has ever looked 
down tenderly at anyone; feels a sudden fierce pain at the 
thought; dismisses the thought as impossible; wonders, 
nevertheless, how tenderness would suit it; thinks she would like
to see a look of tenderness upon it, simply out of curiosity; 
wonders if she ever will.</p>
<p>She rouses herself from her reverie as John, with a smile, 
tells her supper is ready, and they seat themselves opposite each
other, an odd air of embarrassment pervading.</p>
<p>Day by day their work grows harder; day by day the foe grows 
stronger, fiercer, more all-conquering; and day by day, fighting 
side by side against it, John Ingerfield and Anne, his wife, draw
closer to each other.&nbsp; On the battle-field of life we learn 
the worth of strength.&nbsp; Anne feels it good, when growing 
weary, to glance up and find him near her; feels it good, amid 
the troubled babel round her, to hear the deep, strong music of 
his voice.</p>
<p>And John, watching Anne&rsquo;s fair figure moving to and fro 
among the stricken and the mourning; watching her fair, 
fluttering hands, busy with their holy work, her deep, 
soul-haunting eyes, changeful with the light and shade of 
tenderness; listening to her sweet, clear voice, laughing with 
the joyous, comforting the comfortless, gently commanding, softly
pleading, finds creeping into his brain strange new thoughts 
concerning women&mdash;concerning this one woman in 
particular.</p>
<p>One day, rummaging over an old chest, he comes across a 
coloured picture-book of Bible stories.&nbsp; He turns the torn 
pages fondly, remembering the Sunday afternoons of long 
ago.&nbsp; At one picture, wherein are represented many angels, 
he pauses; for in one of the younger angels of the 
group&mdash;one not quite so severe of feature as her 
sisters&mdash;he fancies he can trace resemblance to Anne.&nbsp; 
He lingers long over it.&nbsp; Suddenly there rushes through his 
brain the thought, How good to stoop and kiss the sweet feet of 
such a woman! and, thinking it, he blushes like a boy.</p>
<p>So from the soil of human suffering spring the flowers of 
human love and joy, and from the flowers there fall the seeds of 
infinite pity for human pain, God shaping all things to His 
ends.</p>
<p>Thinking of Anne, John&rsquo;s face grows gentler, his hand 
kinder; dreaming of him, her heart grows stronger, deeper, 
fuller.&nbsp; Every available room in the warehouse has been 
turned into a ward, and the little hospital is open free to all, 
for John and Anne feel that the whole world are their 
people.&nbsp; The piled-up casks are gone&mdash;shipped to 
Woolwich and Gravesend, bundled anywhere out of the way, as 
though oil and tallow and the gold they can be stirred into were 
matters of small moment in this world, not to be thought of 
beside such a thing as the helping of a human brother in sore 
strait.</p>
<p>All the labour of the day seems light to them, looking forward
to the hour when they sit together in John&rsquo;s old shabby 
dining-room above the counting-house.&nbsp; Yet a looker-on might
imagine such times dull to them; for they are strangely shy of 
one another, strangely sparing of words&mdash;fearful of opening 
the flood-gates of speech, feeling the pressure of the pent-up 
thought.</p>
<p>One evening, John, throwing out words, not as a sop to the 
necessity for talk, but as a bait to catch Anne&rsquo;s voice, 
mentions girdle-cakes, remembers that his old housekeeper used to
be famous for the making of them, and wonders if she has 
forgotten the art.</p>
<p>Anne, answering tremulously, as though girdle-cakes were a 
somewhat delicate topic, claims to be a successful amateur of 
them herself.&nbsp; John, having been given always to understand 
that the talent for them was exceedingly rare, and one usually 
hereditary, respectfully doubts Anne&rsquo;s capabilities, 
deferentially suggesting that she is thinking of scones.&nbsp; 
Anne indignantly repudiates the insinuation, knows quite well the
difference between girdle-cakes and scones, offers to prove her 
powers by descending into the kitchen and making some then and 
there, if John will accompany her and find the things for 
her.</p>
<p>John accepts the challenge, and, guiding Anne with one shy, 
awkward hand, while holding aloft a candle in the other, leads 
the way.&nbsp; It is past ten o&rsquo;clock, and the old 
housekeeper is in bed.&nbsp; At each creaking stair they pause, 
to listen if the noise has awakened her; then, finding all 
silent, creep forward again, with suppressed laughter, wondering 
with alarm, half feigned, half real, what the prim, methodical 
dame would say were she to come down and catch them.</p>
<p>They reach the kitchen, thanks more to the suggestions of a 
friendly cat than to John&rsquo;s acquaintanceship with the 
geography of his own house; and Anne rakes together the fire and 
clears the table for her work.&nbsp; What possible use John is to
her&mdash;what need there was for her stipulating that he should 
accompany her, Anne might find it difficult, if examined, to 
explain satisfactorily.&nbsp; As for his &ldquo;finding the 
things&rdquo; for her, he has not the faintest notion where they 
are, and possesses no natural aptitude for discovery.&nbsp; Told 
to find flour, he industriously searches for it in the dresser 
drawers; sent for the rolling-pin&mdash;the nature and 
characteristics of rolling-pins being described to him for his 
guidance&mdash;he returns, after a prolonged absence, with the 
copper stick.&nbsp; Anne laughs at him; but really it would seem 
as though she herself were almost as stupid, for not until her 
hands are covered with flour does it occur to her that she has 
not taken that preliminary step in all cooking operations of 
rolling up her sleeves.</p>
<p>She holds out her arms to John, first one and then the other, 
asking him sweetly if he minds doing it for her.&nbsp; John is 
very slow and clumsy, but Anne stands very patient.&nbsp; Inch by
inch he peels the black sleeve from the white round arm.&nbsp; 
Hundreds of times must he have seen those fair arms, bare to the 
shoulder, sparkling with jewels; but never before has he seen 
their wondrous beauty.&nbsp; He longs to clasp them round his 
neck, yet is fearful lest his trembling fingers touching them as 
he performs his tantalising task may offend her.&nbsp; Anne 
thanks him, and apologises for having given him so much trouble, 
and he murmurs some meaningless reply, and stands foolishly 
silent, watching her.</p>
<p>Anne seems to find one hand sufficient for her cake-making, 
for the other rests idly on the table&mdash;very near to one of 
John&rsquo;s, as she would see were not her eyes so intent upon 
her work.&nbsp; How the impulse came to him, where 
he&mdash;grave, sober, business-man John&mdash;learnt such 
story-book ways can never be known; but in one instant he is down
on both knees, smothering the floury hand with kisses, and the 
next moment Anne&rsquo;s arms are round his neck and her lips 
against his, and the barrier between them is swept away, and the 
deep waters of their love rush together.</p>
<p>With that kiss they enter a new life whereinto one may not 
follow them.&nbsp; One thinks it must have been a life made 
strangely beautiful by self-forgetfulness, strangely sweet by 
mutual devotion&mdash;a life too ideal, perhaps, to have remained
for long undimmed by the mists of earth.</p>
<p>They who remember them at that time speak of them in hushed 
tones, as one speaks of visions.&nbsp; It would almost seem as 
though from their faces in those days there shone a radiance, as 
though in their voices dwelt a tenderness beyond the tenderness 
of man.</p>
<p>They seem never to rest, never to weary.&nbsp; Day and night, 
through that little stricken world, they come and go, bearing 
healing and peace, till at last the plague, like some gorged 
beast of prey, slinks slowly back towards its lair, and men raise
their heads and breathe.</p>
<p>One afternoon, returning from a somewhat longer round than 
usual, John feels a weariness creeping into his limbs, and 
quickens his step, eager to reach home and rest.&nbsp; Anne, who 
has been up all the previous night, is asleep, and not wishing to
disturb her, he goes into the dining-room and sits down in the 
easy chair before the fire.&nbsp; The room strikes cold.&nbsp; He
stirs the logs, but they give out no greater heat.&nbsp; He draws
his chair right in front of them, and sits leaning over them with
his feet on the hearth and his hands outstretched towards the 
blaze; yet he still shivers.</p>
<p>Twilight fills the room and deepens into dusk.&nbsp; He 
wonders listlessly how it is that Time seems to be moving with 
such swift strides.&nbsp; After a while he hears a voice close to
him, speaking in a slow, monotonous tone&mdash;a voice curiously 
familiar to him, though he cannot tell to whom it belongs.&nbsp; 
He does not turn his head, but sits listening to it 
drowsily.&nbsp; It is talking about tallow: one hundred and 
ninety-four casks of tallow, and they must all stand one inside 
the other.&nbsp; It cannot be done, the voice complains 
pathetically.&nbsp; They will not go inside each other.&nbsp; It 
is no good pushing them.&nbsp; See! they only roll out again.</p>
<p>The voice grows wearily fretful.&nbsp; Oh! why do they persist
when they see it is impossible?&nbsp; What fools they all 
are!</p>
<p>Suddenly he recollects the voice, and starts up and stares 
wildly about him, trying to remember where he is.&nbsp; With a 
fierce straining of his will he grips the brain that is slipping 
away from him, and holds it.&nbsp; As soon as he feels sure of 
himself he steals out of the room and down the stairs.</p>
<p>In the hall he stands listening; the house is very 
silent.&nbsp; He goes to the head of the stairs leading to the 
kitchen and calls softly to the old housekeeper, and she comes up
to him, panting and grunting as she climbs each step.&nbsp; 
Keeping some distance from her, he asks in a whisper where Anne 
is.&nbsp; The woman answers that she is in the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I have been called away suddenly on 
business,&rdquo; he says, speaking in quick, low tones: &ldquo;I 
shall be away for some days.&nbsp; Tell her to leave here and 
return home immediately.&nbsp; They can do without her here 
now.&nbsp; Tell her to go back home at once.&nbsp; I will join 
her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moves toward the door but stops and faces round again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I beg and entreat her not to stop in this 
place an hour longer.&nbsp; There is nothing to keep her 
now.&nbsp; It is all over: there is nothing that cannot be done 
by any one.&nbsp; Tell her she must go home&mdash;this very 
night.&nbsp; Tell her if she loves me to leave this place at 
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, a little bewildered by his vehemence, promises, and
disappears down the stairs.&nbsp; He takes his hat and cloak from
the chair on which he had thrown them, and turns once more to 
cross the hall.&nbsp; As he does so, the door opens and Anne 
enters.</p>
<p>He darts back into the shadow, squeezing himself against the 
wall.&nbsp; Anne calls to him laughingly, then, as he does not 
answer, with a frightened accent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&mdash;John, dear.&nbsp; Was not that you?&nbsp; 
Are not you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He holds his breath, and crouches still closer into the dark 
corner; and Anne, thinking she must have been mistaken in the dim
light, passes him and goes upstairs.</p>
<p>Then he creeps stealthily to the door, lets himself out and 
closes it softly behind him.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a few minutes the old housekeeper plods 
upstairs and delivers John&rsquo;s message.&nbsp; Anne, finding 
it altogether incomprehensible, subjects the poor dame to severe 
examination, but fails to elicit anything further.&nbsp; What is 
the meaning of it?&nbsp; What &ldquo;business&rdquo; can have 
compelled John, who for ten weeks has never let the word escape 
his lips, to leave her like this&mdash;without a word! without a 
kiss!&nbsp; Then suddenly she remembers the incident of a few 
moments ago, when she had called to him, thinking she saw him, 
and he did not answer; and the whole truth strikes her full in 
the heart.</p>
<p>She refastens the bonnet-strings she has been slowly untying, 
and goes down and out into the wet street.</p>
<p>She makes her way rapidly to the house of the only doctor 
resident in the neighbourhood&mdash;a big, brusque-mannered man, 
who throughout these terrible two months has been their chief 
stay and help.&nbsp; He meets her on her entrance with an 
embarrassed air that tells its own tale, and at once renders 
futile his clumsy attempts at acting:&mdash;</p>
<p>How should he know where John is?&nbsp; Who told her John had 
the fever&mdash;a great, strong, hulking fellow like that?&nbsp; 
She has been working too hard, and has got fever on the 
brain.&nbsp; She must go straight back home, or she will be 
having it herself.&nbsp; She is more likely to take it than 
John.</p>
<p>Anne, waiting till he has finished jerking out sentences while
stamping up and down the room, says gently, taking no notice of 
his denials,&mdash;&ldquo;If you will not tell me I must find out
from some one else&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, her 
quick eyes noting his momentary hesitation, she lays her little 
hand on his rough paw, and, with the shamelessness of a woman who
loves deeply, wheedles everything out of him that he has promised
to keep secret.</p>
<p>He stops her, however, as she is leaving the room.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in to him now,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;he 
will worry about you.&nbsp; Wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, while John lies counting endless casks of tallow, Anne 
sits by his side, tending her last &ldquo;case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often in his delirium he calls her name, and she takes his 
fevered hand in hers and holds it, and he falls asleep.</p>
<p>Each morning the doctor comes and looks at him, asks a few 
questions and gives a few commonplace directions, but makes no 
comment.&nbsp; It would be idle his attempting to deceive 
her.</p>
<p>The days move slowly through the darkened room.&nbsp; Anne 
watches his thin hands grow thinner, his sunken eyes grow bigger;
yet remains strangely calm, almost contented.</p>
<p>Very near the end there comes an hour when John wakes as from 
a dream, and remembers all things clearly.</p>
<p>He looks at her half gratefully, half reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, why are you here?&rdquo; he asks, in a low, 
laboured voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did they not give you my 
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer she turns her deep eyes upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have gone away and left me here to 
die?&rdquo; she questions him, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>She bends her head down nearer to him, so that her soft hair 
falls about his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our lives were one, dear,&rdquo; she whispers to 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not have lived without you; God knew 
that.&nbsp; We shall be together always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kisses him, and laying his head upon her breast, softly 
strokes it as she might a child&rsquo;s; and he puts his weak 
arms around her.</p>
<p>Later on she feels them growing cold about her, and lays him 
gently back upon the bed, looks for the last time into his eyes, 
then draws the lids down over them.</p>
<p>His people ask that they may bury him in the churchyard hard 
by, so that he may always be among them; and, Anne consenting, 
they do all things needful with their own hands, wishful that no 
unloving labour may be mingled with their work.&nbsp; They lay 
him close to the porch, where, going in and out the church, their
feet will pass near to him; and one among them who is cunning 
with the graver&rsquo;s chisel shapes the stone.</p>
<p>At the head he carves in bas-relief the figure of the good 
Samaritan tending the brother fallen by the way, and underneath 
the letters, &ldquo;In Remembrance of John Ingerfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thinks to put a verse of Scripture immediately after; but 
the gruff doctor says, &ldquo;Better leave a space, in case you 
want to add another name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the stone remains a little while unfinished; till the same 
hand carves thereon, a few weeks later, &ldquo;And of Anne, his 
Wife.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE WOMAN OF THE S&AElig;TER.</h2>
<p>Wild-reindeer stalking is hardly so exciting a sport as the 
evening&rsquo;s verandah talk in Norroway hotels would lead the 
trustful traveller to suppose.&nbsp; Under the charge of your 
guide, a very young man with the dreamy, wistful eyes of those 
who live in valleys, you leave the farmstead early in the 
forenoon, arriving towards twilight at the desolate hut which, 
for so long as you remain upon the uplands, will be your somewhat
cheerless headquarters.</p>
<p>Next morning, in the chill, mist-laden dawn, you rise; and, 
after a breakfast of coffee and dried fish, shoulder your 
Remington, and step forth silently into the raw, damp air; the 
guide locking the door behind you, the key grating harshly in the
rusty lock.</p>
<p>For hour after hour you toil over the steep, stony ground, or 
wind through the pines, speaking in whispers, lest your voice 
reach the quick ears of your prey, that keeps its head ever 
pressed against the wind.&nbsp; Here and there, in the hollows of
the hills lie wide fields of snow, over which you pick your steps
thoughtfully, listening to the smothered thunder of the torrent, 
tunnelling its way beneath your feet, and wondering whether the 
frozen arch above it be at all points as firm as is 
desirable.&nbsp; Now and again, as in single file you walk 
cautiously along some jagged ridge, you catch glimpses of the 
green world, three thousand feet below you; though you gaze not 
long upon the view, for your attention is chiefly directed to 
watching the footprints of the guide, lest by deviating to the 
right or left you find yourself at one stride back in the 
valley&mdash;or, to be more correct, are found there.</p>
<p>These things you do, and as exercise they are healthful and 
invigorating.&nbsp; But a reindeer you never see, and unless, 
overcoming the prejudices of your British-bred conscience, you 
care to take an occasional pop at a fox, you had better have left
your rifle at the hut, and, instead, have brought a stick which 
would have been helpful.&nbsp; Notwithstanding which the guide 
continues sanguine, and in broken English, helped out by stirring
gesture, tells of the terrible slaughter generally done by 
sportsmen under his superintendence, and of the vast herds that 
generally infest these fields; and when you grow sceptical upon 
the subject of Reins he whispers alluringly of Bears.</p>
<p>Once in a way you will come across a track, and will follow it
breathlessly for hours, and it will lead to a sheer 
precipice.&nbsp; Whether the explanation is suicide, or a 
reprehensible tendency on the part of the animal towards 
practical joking, you are left to decide for yourself.&nbsp; 
Then, with many rough miles between you and your rest, you 
abandon the chase.</p>
<p>But I speak from personal experience merely.</p>
<p>All day long we had tramped through the pitiless rain, 
stopping only for an hour at noon to eat some dried venison and 
smoke a pipe beneath the shelter of an overhanging cliff.&nbsp; 
Soon afterwards Michael knocked over a ryper (a bird that will 
hardly take the trouble to hop out of your way) with his 
gun-barrel, which incident cheered us a little; and, later on, 
our flagging spirits were still further revived by the discovery 
of apparently very recent deer-tracks.&nbsp; These we followed, 
forgetful, in our eagerness, of the lengthening distance back to 
the hut, of the fading daylight, of the gathering mist.&nbsp; The
track led us higher and higher, farther and farther into the 
mountains, until on the shores of a desolate rock-bound vand it 
abruptly ended, and we stood staring at one another, and the snow
began to fall.</p>
<p>Unless in the next half-hour we could chance upon a 
s&aelig;ter, this meant passing the night upon the 
mountain.&nbsp; Michael and I looked at the guide; but though, 
with characteristic Norwegian sturdiness, he put a bold face upon
it, we could see that in that deepening darkness he knew no more 
than we did.&nbsp; Wasting no time on words, we made straight for
the nearest point of descent, knowing that any human habitation 
must be far below us.</p>
<p>Down we scrambled, heedless of torn clothes and bleeding 
hands, the darkness pressing closer round us.&nbsp; Then suddenly
it became black&mdash;black as pitch&mdash;and we could only hear
each other.&nbsp; Another step might mean death.&nbsp; We 
stretched out our hands, and felt each other.&nbsp; Why we spoke 
in whispers, I do not know, but we seemed afraid of our own 
voices.&nbsp; We agreed there was nothing for it but to stop 
where we were till morning, clinging to the short grass; so we 
lay there side by side, for what may have been five minutes or 
may have been an hour.&nbsp; Then, attempting to turn, I lost my 
grip and rolled.&nbsp; I made convulsive efforts to clutch the 
ground, but the incline was too steep.&nbsp; How far I fell I 
could not say, but at last something stopped me.&nbsp; I felt it 
cautiously with my foot: it did not yield, so I twisted myself 
round and touched it with my hand.&nbsp; It seemed planted firmly
in the earth.&nbsp; I passed my arm along to the right, then to 
the left.&nbsp; I shouted with joy.&nbsp; It was a fence.</p>
<p>Rising and groping about me, I found an opening, and passed 
through, and crept forward with palms outstretched until I 
touched the logs of a hut; then, feeling my way round, discovered
the door, and knocked.&nbsp; There came no response, so I knocked
louder; then pushed, and the heavy woodwork yielded, 
groaning.&nbsp; But the darkness within was even darker than the 
darkness without.&nbsp; The others had contrived to crawl down 
and join me.&nbsp; Michael struck a wax vesta and held it up, and
slowly the room came out of the darkness and stood round us.</p>
<p>Then something rather startling happened.&nbsp; Giving one 
swift glance about him, our guide uttered a cry, and rushed out 
into the night.&nbsp; We followed to the door, and called after 
him, but only a voice came to us out of the blackness, and the 
only words that we could catch, shrieked back in terror, were: 
&ldquo;<i>S&aelig;tervronen</i>!&nbsp; 
<i>S&aelig;tervronen</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;The woman of the 
s&aelig;ter&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some foolish superstition about the place, I 
suppose,&rdquo; said Michael.&nbsp; &ldquo;In these mountain 
solitudes men breed ghosts for company.&nbsp; Let us make a 
fire.&nbsp; Perhaps, when he sees the light, his desire for food 
and shelter may get the better of his fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We felt about in the small enclosure round the house, and 
gathered juniper and birch-twigs, and kindled a fire upon the 
open stove built in the corner of the room.&nbsp; Fortunately, we
had some dried reindeer and bread in our bag, and on that and the
ryper and the contents of our flasks we supped.&nbsp; Afterwards,
to while away the time, we made an inspection of the strange 
eyrie we had lighted on.</p>
<p>It was an old log-built s&aelig;ter.&nbsp; Some of these 
mountain farmsteads are as old as the stone ruins of other 
countries.&nbsp; Carvings of strange beasts and demons were upon 
its blackened rafters, and on the lintel, in runic letters, ran 
this legend: &ldquo;Hund builded me in the days of 
Haarfager.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house consisted of two large 
apartments.&nbsp; Originally, no doubt, these had been separate 
dwellings standing beside one another, but they were now 
connected by a long, low gallery.&nbsp; Most of the scanty 
furniture was almost as ancient as the walls themselves, but many
articles of a comparatively recent date had been added.&nbsp; All
was now, however, rotting and falling into decay.</p>
<p>The place appeared to have been deserted suddenly by its last 
occupants.&nbsp; Household utensils lay as they were left, rust 
and dirt encrusted on them.&nbsp; An open book, limp and 
mildewed, lay face downwards on the table, while many others were
scattered about both rooms, together with much paper, scored with
faded ink.&nbsp; The curtains hung in shreds about the windows; a
woman&rsquo;s cloak, of an antiquated fashion, drooped from a 
nail behind the door.&nbsp; In an oak chest we found a tumbled 
heap of yellow letters.&nbsp; They were of various dates, 
extending over a period of four months; and with them, apparently
intended to receive them, lay a large envelope, inscribed with an
address in London that has since disappeared.</p>
<p>Strong curiosity overcoming faint scruples, we read them by 
the dull glow of the burning juniper twigs, and, as we lay aside 
the last of them, there rose from the depths below us a wailing 
cry, and all night long it rose and died away, and rose again, 
and died away again; whether born of our brain or of some human 
thing, God knows.</p>
<p>And these, a little altered and shortened, are the 
letters:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Extract from first letter</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, my dear Joyce, what a 
haven of peace this place is to me after the racket and fret of 
town.&nbsp; I am almost quite recovered already, and am growing 
stronger every day; and, joy of joys, my brain has come back to 
me, fresher and more vigorous, I think, for its holiday.&nbsp; In
this silence and solitude my thoughts flow freely, and the 
difficulties of my task are disappearing as if by magic.&nbsp; We
are perched upon a tiny plateau halfway up the mountain.&nbsp; On
one side the rock rises almost perpendicularly, piercing the sky;
while on the other, two thousand feet below us, the torrent hurls
itself into the black waters of the fiord.&nbsp; The house 
consists of two rooms&mdash;or, rather, it is two cabins 
connected by a passage.&nbsp; The larger one we use as a living 
room, and the other is our sleeping apartment.&nbsp; We have no 
servant, but do everything for ourselves.&nbsp; I fear sometimes 
Muriel must find it lonely.&nbsp; The nearest human habitation is
eight miles away, across the mountain, and not a soul comes near 
us.&nbsp; I spend as much time as I can with her, however, during
the day, and make up for it by working at night after she has 
gone to sleep; and when I question her, she only laughs, and 
answers that she loves to have me all to herself.&nbsp; (Here you
will smile cynically, I know, and say, &lsquo;Humph, I wonder 
will she say the same when they have been married six years 
instead of six months.&rsquo;)&nbsp; At the rate I am working now
I shall have finished my first volume by the spring, and then, my
dear fellow, you must try and come over, and we will walk and 
talk together &lsquo;amid these storm-reared temples of the 
gods.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have felt a new man since I arrived 
here.&nbsp; Instead of having to &lsquo;cudgel my brains,&rsquo; 
as we say, thoughts crowd upon me.&nbsp; This work will make my 
name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Part of the third letter</i>, <i>the second being mere talk
about the book</i> (<i>a history apparently</i>) <i>that the man 
was writing</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Joyce</span>,&mdash;I have written you two letters&mdash;this 
will make the third&mdash;but have been unable to post 
them.&nbsp; Every day I have been expecting a visit from some 
farmer or villager, for the Norwegians are kindly people towards 
strangers&mdash;to say nothing of the inducements of trade.&nbsp;
A fortnight having passed, however, and the commissariat question
having become serious, I yesterday set out before dawn, and made 
my way down to the valley; and this gives me something to tell 
you.&nbsp; Nearing the village, I met a peasant woman.&nbsp; To 
my intense surprise, instead of returning my salutation, she 
stared at me, as if I were some wild animal, and shrank away from
me as far as the width of the road would permit.&nbsp; In the 
village the same experience awaited me.&nbsp; The children ran 
from me, the people avoided me.&nbsp; At last a grey-haired old 
man appeared to take pity on me, and from him I learnt the 
explanation of the mystery.&nbsp; It seems there is a strange 
superstition attaching to this house in which we are 
living.&nbsp; My things were brought up here by the two men who 
accompanied me from Drontheim, but the natives are afraid to go 
near the place, and prefer to keep as far as possible from any 
one connected with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The story is that the house was built by one Hund, 
&lsquo;a maker of runes&rsquo; (one of the old saga writers, no 
doubt), who lived here with his young wife.&nbsp; All went 
peacefully until, unfortunately for him, a certain maiden 
stationed at a neighbouring s&aelig;ter grew to love him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I am telling you what you know, but a 
&lsquo;s&aelig;ter&rsquo; is the name given to the upland 
pastures to which, during the summer, are sent the cattle, 
generally under the charge of one or more of the maids.&nbsp; 
Here for three months these girls will live in their lonely huts,
entirely shut off from the world.&nbsp; Customs change little in 
this land.&nbsp; Two or three such stations are within climbing 
distance of this house, at this day, looked after by the 
farmers&rsquo; daughters, as in the days of Hund, &lsquo;maker of
runes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night, by devious mountain paths, the woman would
come and tap lightly at Hund&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Hund had built 
himself two cabins, one behind the other (these are now, as I 
think I have explained to you, connected by a passage); the 
smaller one was the homestead; in the other he carved and wrote, 
so that while the young wife slept the &lsquo;maker of 
runes&rsquo; and the s&aelig;ter woman sat whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night, however, the wife learnt all things, but 
said no word.&nbsp; Then, as now, the ravine in front of the 
enclosure was crossed by a slight bridge of planks, and over this
bridge the woman of the s&aelig;ter passed and repassed each 
night.&nbsp; On a day when Hund had gone down to fish in the 
fiord, the wife took an axe, and hacked and hewed at the bridge, 
yet it still looked firm and solid; and that night, as Hund sat 
waiting in his workshop, there struck upon his ears a piercing 
cry, and a crashing of logs and rolling rock, and then again the 
dull roaring of the torrent far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woman did not die unavenged; for that winter a 
man, skating far down the fiord, noticed a curious object 
embedded in the ice; and when, stooping, he looked closer, he saw
two corpses, one gripping the other by the throat, and the bodies
were the bodies of Hund and his young wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, they say, the woman of the s&aelig;ter 
haunts Hund&rsquo;s house, and if she sees a light within she 
taps upon the door, and no man may keep her out.&nbsp; Many, at 
different times, have tried to occupy the house, but strange 
tales are told of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Men do not live at 
Hund&rsquo;s s&aelig;ter,&rsquo; said my old grey-haired friend, 
concluding his tale,&mdash;&lsquo;they die there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have persuaded some of the braver of the villagers to
bring what provisions and other necessaries we require up to a 
plateau about a mile from the house and leave them there.&nbsp; 
That is the most I have been able to do.&nbsp; It comes somewhat 
as a shock to one to find men and women&mdash;fairly educated and
intelligent as many of them are&mdash;slaves to fears that one 
would expect a child to laugh at.&nbsp; But there is no reasoning
with superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Extract from the same letter</i>, <i>but from a part 
seemingly written a day or two later</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At home I should have forgotten such a tale
an hour after I had heard it, but these mountain fastnesses seem 
strangely fit to be the last stronghold of the 
supernatural.&nbsp; The woman haunts me already.&nbsp; At night 
instead of working, I find myself listening for her tapping at 
the door; and yesterday an incident occurred that makes me fear 
for my own common sense.&nbsp; I had gone out for a long walk 
alone, and the twilight was thickening into darkness as I neared 
home.&nbsp; Suddenly looking up from my reverie, I saw, standing 
on a knoll the other side of the ravine, the figure of a 
woman.&nbsp; She held a cloak about her head, and I could not see
her face.&nbsp; I took off my cap, and called out a good-night to
her, but she never moved or spoke.&nbsp; Then&mdash;God knows 
why, for my brain was full of other thoughts at the time&mdash;a 
clammy chill crept over me, and my tongue grew dry and 
parched.&nbsp; I stood rooted to the spot, staring at her across 
the yawning gorge that divided us; and slowly she moved away, and
passed into the gloom, and I continued my way.&nbsp; I have said 
nothing to Muriel, and shall not.&nbsp; The effect the story has 
had upon myself warns me not to do so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>From a letter dated eleven days later</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She has come.&nbsp; I have known she would,
since that evening I saw her on the mountain; and last night she 
came, and we have sat and looked into each other&rsquo;s 
eyes.&nbsp; You will say, of course, that I am mad&mdash;that I 
have not recovered from my fever&mdash;that I have been working 
too hard&mdash;that I have heard a foolish tale, and that it has 
filled my overstrung brain with foolish fancies: I have told 
myself all that.&nbsp; But the thing came, nevertheless&mdash;a 
creature of flesh and blood? a creature of air? a creature of my 
own imagination?&mdash;what matter? it was real to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came last night, as I sat working, alone.&nbsp; Each
night I have waited for it, listened for it&mdash;longed for it, 
I know now.&nbsp; I heard the passing of its feet upon the 
bridge, the tapping of its hand upon the door, three 
times&mdash;tap, tap, tap.&nbsp; I felt my loins grow cold, and a
pricking pain about my head; and I gripped my chair with both 
hands, and waited, and again there came the tapping&mdash;tap, 
tap, tap.&nbsp; I rose and slipped the bolt of the door leading 
to the other room, and again I waited, and again there came the 
tapping&mdash;tap, tap, tap.&nbsp; Then I opened the heavy outer 
door, and the wind rushed past me, scattering my papers, and the 
woman entered in, and I closed the door behind her.&nbsp; She 
threw her hood back from her head, and unwound a kerchief from 
about her neck, and laid it on the table.&nbsp; Then she crossed 
and sat before the fire, and I noticed her bare feet were damp 
with the night dew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood over against her and gazed at her, and she 
smiled at me&mdash;a strange, wicked smile, but I could have laid
my soul at her feet.&nbsp; She never spoke or moved, and neither 
did I feel the need of spoken words, for I understood the meaning
of those upon the Mount when they said, &lsquo;Let us make here 
tabernacles: it is good for us to be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long a time passed thus I do not know, but suddenly
the woman held her hand up, listening, and there came a faint 
sound from the other room.&nbsp; Then swiftly she drew her hood 
about her face and passed out, closing the door softly behind 
her; and I drew back the bolt of the inner door and waited, and 
hearing nothing more, sat down, and must have fallen asleep in my
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I awoke, and instantly there flashed through my mind 
the thought of the kerchief the woman had left behind her, and I 
started from my chair to hide it.&nbsp; But the table was already
laid for breakfast, and my wife sat with her elbows on the table 
and her head between her hands, watching me with a look in her 
eyes that was new to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She kissed me, though her lips were cold; and I argued 
to myself that the whole thing must have been a dream.&nbsp; But 
later in the day, passing the open door when her back was towards
me, I saw her take the kerchief from a locked chest and look at 
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told myself it must have been a kerchief of her 
own, and that all the rest has been my imagination; that, if not,
then my strange visitant was no spirit, but a woman; and that, if
human thing knows human thing, it was no creature of flesh and 
blood that sat beside me last night.&nbsp; Besides, what woman 
would she be?&nbsp; The nearest s&aelig;ter is a 
three-hours&rsquo; climb to a strong man, and the paths are 
dangerous even in daylight: what woman would have found them in 
the night?&nbsp; What woman would have chilled the air around 
her, and have made the blood flow cold through all my 
veins?&nbsp; Yet if she come again I will speak to her.&nbsp; I 
will stretch out my hand and see whether she be mortal thing or 
only air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The fifth letter</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Joyce</span>,&mdash;Whether your eyes will ever see these letters
is doubtful.&nbsp; From this place I shall never send them.&nbsp;
They would read to you as the ravings of a madman.&nbsp; If ever 
I return to England I may one day show them to you, but when I do
it will be when I, with you, can laugh over them.&nbsp; At 
present I write them merely to hide away,&mdash;putting the words
down on paper saves my screaming them aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She comes each night now, taking the same seat beside 
the embers, and fixing upon me those eyes, with the hell-light in
them, that burn into my brain; and at rare times she smiles, and 
all my being passes out of me, and is hers.&nbsp; I make no 
attempt to work.&nbsp; I sit listening for her footsteps on the 
creaking bridge, for the rustling of her feet upon the grass, for
the tapping of her hand upon the door.&nbsp; No word is uttered 
between us.&nbsp; Each day I say: &lsquo;When she comes to-night 
I will speak to her.&nbsp; I will stretch out my hand and touch 
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet when she enters, all thought and will goes 
out from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, as I stood gazing at her, my soul filled 
with her wondrous beauty as a lake with moonlight, her lips 
parted, and she started from her chair; and, turning, I thought I
saw a white face pressed against the window, but as I looked it 
vanished.&nbsp; Then she drew her cloak about her, and passed 
out.&nbsp; I slid back the bolt I always draw now, and stole into
the other room, and, taking down the lantern, held it above the 
bed.&nbsp; But Muriel&rsquo;s eyes were closed as if in 
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Extract from the sixth letter</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not the night I fear, but the 
day.&nbsp; I hate the sight of this woman with whom I live, whom 
I call &lsquo;wife.&rsquo;&nbsp; I shrink from the blow of her 
cold lips, the curse of her stony eyes.&nbsp; She has seen, she 
has learnt; I feel it, I know it.&nbsp; Yet she winds her arms 
around my neck, and calls me sweetheart, and smoothes my hair 
with her soft, false hands.&nbsp; We speak mocking words of love 
to one another, but I know her cruel eyes are ever following 
me.&nbsp; She is plotting her revenge, and I hate her, I hate 
her, I hate her!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Part of the seventh letter</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This morning I went down to the 
fiord.&nbsp; I told her I should not be back until the 
evening.&nbsp; She stood by the door watching me until we were 
mere specks to one another, and a promontory of the mountain shut
me from view.&nbsp; Then, turning aside from the track, I made my
way, running and stumbling over the jagged ground, round to the 
other side of the mountain, and began to climb again.&nbsp; It 
was slow, weary work.&nbsp; Often I had to go miles out of my 
road to avoid a ravine, and twice I reached a high point only to 
have to descend again.&nbsp; But at length I crossed the ridge, 
and crept down to a spot from where, concealed, I could spy upon 
my own house.&nbsp; She&mdash;my wife&mdash;stood by the flimsy 
bridge.&nbsp; A short hatchet, such as butchers use, was in her 
hand.&nbsp; She leant against a pine trunk, with her arm behind 
her, as one stands whose back aches with long stooping in some 
cramped position; and even at that distance I could see the cruel
smile about her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I recrossed the ridge, and crawled down again, 
and, waiting until evening, walked slowly up the path.&nbsp; As I
came in view of the house she saw me, and waved her handkerchief 
to me, and in answer I waved my hat, and shouted curses at her 
that the wind whirled away into the torrent.&nbsp; She met me 
with a kiss, and I breathed no hint to her that I had seen.&nbsp;
Let her devil&rsquo;s work remain undisturbed.&nbsp; Let it prove
to me what manner of thing this is that haunts me.&nbsp; If it be
a spirit, then the bridge wilt bear it safely; if it be 
woman&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I dismiss the thought.&nbsp; If it be human thing, 
why does it sit gazing at me, never speaking? why does my tongue 
refuse to question it? why does all power forsake me in its 
presence, so that I stand as in a dream?&nbsp; Yet if it be 
spirit, why do I hear the passing of her feet? and why does the 
night-rain glisten on her hair?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I force myself back into my chair.&nbsp; It is far into
the night, and I am alone, waiting, listening.&nbsp; If it be 
spirit, she will come to me; and if it be woman, I shall hear her
cry above the storm&mdash;unless it be a demon mocking me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard the cry.&nbsp; It rose, piercing and 
shrill, above the storm, above the riving and rending of the 
bridge, above the downward crashing of the logs and loosened 
stones.&nbsp; I hear it as I listen now.&nbsp; It is cleaving its
way upward from the depths below.&nbsp; It is wailing through the
room as I sit writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have crawled upon my belly to the utmost edge of the 
still standing pier, until I could feel with my hand the jagged 
splinters left by the fallen planks, and have looked down.&nbsp; 
But the chasm was full to the brim with darkness.&nbsp; I 
shouted, but the wind shook my voice into mocking laughter.&nbsp;
I sit here, feebly striking at the madness that is creeping 
nearer and nearer to me.&nbsp; I tell myself the whole thing is 
but the fever in my brain.&nbsp; The bridge was rotten.&nbsp; The
storm was strong.&nbsp; The cry is but a single one among the 
many voices of the mountain.&nbsp; Yet still I listen; and it 
rises, clear and shrill, above the moaning of the pines, above 
the sobbing of the waters.&nbsp; It beats like blows upon my 
skull, and I know that she will never come again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Extract from the last letter</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I shall address an envelope to you, and 
leave it among these letters.&nbsp; Then, should I never come 
back, some chance wanderer may one day find and post them to you,
and you will know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My books and writings remain untouched.&nbsp; We sit 
together of a night&mdash;this woman I call &lsquo;wife&rsquo; 
and I&mdash;she holding in her hands some knitted thing that 
never grows longer by a single stitch, and I with a volume before
me that is ever open at the same page.&nbsp; And day and night we
watch each other stealthily, moving to and fro about the silent 
house; and at times, looking round swiftly, I catch the smile 
upon her lips before she has time to smooth it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We speak like strangers about this and that, making 
talk to hide our thoughts.&nbsp; We make a pretence of busying 
ourselves about whatever will help us to keep apart from one 
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night, sitting here between the shadows and the dull
glow of the smouldering twigs, I sometimes think I hear the 
tapping I have learnt to listen for, and I start from my seat, 
and softly open the door and look out.&nbsp; But only the Night 
stands there.&nbsp; Then I close-to the latch, and she&mdash;the 
living woman&mdash;asks me in her purring voice what sound I 
heard, hiding a smile as she stoops low over her work; and I 
answer lightly, and, moving towards her, put my arm about her, 
feeling her softness and her suppleness, and wondering, supposing
I held her close to me with one arm while pressing her from me 
with the other, how long before I should hear the cracking of her
bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For here, amid these savage solitudes, I also am grown 
savage.&nbsp; The old primeval passions of love and hate stir 
within me, and they are fierce and cruel and strong, beyond what 
you men of the later ages could understand.&nbsp; The culture of 
the centuries has fallen from me as a flimsy garment whirled away
by the mountain wind; the old savage instincts of the race lie 
bare.&nbsp; One day I shall twine my fingers about her full white
throat, and her eyes will slowly come towards me, and her lips 
will part, and the red tongue creep out; and backwards, step by 
step, I shall push her before me, gazing the while upon her 
bloodless face, and it will be my turn to smile.&nbsp; Backwards 
through the open door, backwards along the garden path between 
the juniper bushes, backwards till her heels are overhanging the 
ravine, and she grips life with nothing but her little toes, I 
shall force her, step by step, before me.&nbsp; Then I shall lean
forward, closer, closer, till I kiss her purpling lips, and down,
down, down, past the startled sea-birds, past the white spray of 
the foss, past the downward peeping pines, down, down, down, we 
will go together, till we find the thing that lies sleeping 
beneath the waters of the fiord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these words ended the last letter, unsigned.&nbsp; At the
first streak of dawn we left the house, and, after much 
wandering, found our way back to the valley.&nbsp; But of our 
guide we heard no news.&nbsp; Whether he remained still upon the 
mountain, or whether by some false step he had perished upon that
night, we never learnt.</p>
<h2>VARIETY PATTER.</h2>
<p>My first appearance at a Music Hall was in the year one 
thousand eight hundred and s---.&nbsp; Well, I would rather not 
mention the exact date.&nbsp; I was fourteen at the time.&nbsp; 
It was during the Christmas holidays, and my aunt had given me 
five shillings to go and see Phelps&mdash;I think it was 
Phelps&mdash;in <i>Coriolanus</i>&mdash;I think it was 
<i>Coriolanus</i>.&nbsp; Anyhow, it was to see a high-class and 
improving entertainment, I know.</p>
<p>I suggested that I should induce young Skegson, who lived in 
our road, to go with me.&nbsp; Skegson is a barrister now, and 
could not tell you the difference between a knave of clubs and a 
club of knaves.&nbsp; A few years hence he will, if he works 
hard, be innocent enough for a judge.&nbsp; But at the period of 
which I speak he was a red-haired boy of worldly tastes, 
notwithstanding which I loved him as a brother.&nbsp; My dear 
mother wished to see him before consenting to the arrangement, so
as to be able to form her own opinion as to whether he was a fit 
and proper companion for me; and, accordingly, he was invited to 
tea.&nbsp; He came, and made a most favourable impression upon 
both my mother and my aunt.&nbsp; He had a way of talking about 
the advantages of application to study in early life, and the 
duties of youth towards those placed in authority over it, that 
won for him much esteem in grown-up circles.&nbsp; The spirit of 
the Bar had descended upon Skegson at a very early period of his 
career.</p>
<p>My aunt, indeed, was so much pleased with him that she gave 
him two shillings towards his own expenses (&ldquo;sprung half a 
dollar&rdquo; was how he explained the transaction when we were 
outside), and commended me to his especial care.</p>
<p>Skegson was very silent during the journey.&nbsp; An idea was 
evidently maturing in his mind.&nbsp; At the Angel he stopped and
said: &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll 
do.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go and see that rot.&nbsp; 
Let&rsquo;s go to a Music Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gasped for breath.&nbsp; I had heard of Music Halls.&nbsp; A
stout lady had denounced them across our dinner table on one 
occasion&mdash;fixing the while a steely eye upon her husband, 
who sat opposite and seemed uncomfortable&mdash;as low, horrid 
places, where people smoked and drank, and wore short skirts, and
had added an opinion that they ought to be put down by the 
police&mdash;whether the skirts or the halls she did not 
explain.&nbsp; I also recollected that our charwoman, whose son 
had lately left London for a protracted stay in Devonshire, had, 
in conversation with my mother, dated his downfall from the day 
when he first visited one of these places; and likewise that Mrs.
Philcox&rsquo;s nursemaid, upon her confessing that she had spent
an evening at one with her young man, had been called a shameless
hussy, and summarily dismissed as being no longer a fit associate
for the baby.</p>
<p>But the spirit of lawlessness was strong within me in those 
days, so that I hearkened to the voice of Skegson, the tempter, 
and he lured my feet from the paths that led to virtue and 
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, and we wandered into the broad and crowded 
ways that branch off from the Angel towards Merry Islington.</p>
<p>Skegson insisted that we should do the thing in style, so we 
stopped at a shop near the Agricultural Hall and purchased some 
big cigars.&nbsp; A huge card in the window claimed for these 
that they were &ldquo;the most satisfactory twopenny smokes in 
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; I smoked two of them during the evening, and
never felt more satisfied&mdash;using the word in its true sense,
as implying that a person has had enough of a thing, and does not
desire any more of it, just then&mdash;in all my life.&nbsp; 
Where we went, and what we saw, my memory is not very clear 
upon.&nbsp; We sat at a little marble table.&nbsp; I know it was 
marble because it was so hard, and cool to the head.&nbsp; From 
out of the smoky mist a ponderous creature of strange, undefined 
shape floated heavily towards us, and deposited a squat tumbler 
in front of me containing a pale yellowish liquor, which 
subsequent investigation has led me to believe must have been 
Scotch whisky.&nbsp; It seemed to me then the most nauseous stuff
I had ever swallowed.&nbsp; It is curious to look back and notice
how one&rsquo;s tastes change.</p>
<p>I reached home very late and very sick.&nbsp; That was my 
first dissipation, and, as a lesson, it has been of more 
practical use to me than all the good books and sermons in the 
world could have been.&nbsp; I can remember to this day standing 
in the middle of the room in my night-shirt, trying to catch my 
bed as it came round.</p>
<p>Next morning I confessed everything to my mother, and, for 
several months afterwards, was a reformed character.&nbsp; 
Indeed, the pendulum of my conscience swung too far the other 
way, and I grew exaggeratedly remorseful and unhealthily 
moral.</p>
<p>There was published in those days, for the edification of 
young people, a singularly pessimistic periodical, entitled 
<i>The Children&rsquo;s Band of Hope Review</i>.&nbsp; It was a 
magazine much in favour among grown-up people, and a bound copy 
of Vol. IX. had lately been won by my sister as a prize for 
punctuality (I fancy she must have exhausted all the virtue she 
ever possessed, in that direction, upon the winning of that 
prize.&nbsp; At all events, I have noticed no ostentatious 
display of the quality in her later life.)&nbsp; I had formerly 
expressed contempt for this book, but now, in my regenerate 
state, I took a morbid pleasure in poring over its denunciations 
of sin and sinners.&nbsp; There was one picture in it that 
appeared peculiarly applicable to myself.&nbsp; It represented a 
gaudily costumed young man, standing on the topmost of three 
steep steps, smoking a large cigar.&nbsp; Behind him was a very 
small church, and below, a bright and not altogether uninviting 
looking hell.&nbsp; The picture was headed &ldquo;The Three Steps
to Ruin,&rdquo; and the three stairs were labelled respectively 
&ldquo;Smoking,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drinking,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Gambling.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had already travelled two-thirds 
of the road!&nbsp; Was I going all the way, or should I be able 
to retrace those steps?&nbsp; I used to lie awake at night and 
think about it till I grew half crazy.&nbsp; Alas! since then I 
have completed the descent, so where my future will be spent I do
not care to think.</p>
<p>Another picture in the book that troubled me was the 
frontispiece.&nbsp; This was a highly-coloured print, 
illustrating the broad and narrow ways.&nbsp; The narrow way led 
upward past a Sunday-school and a lion to a city in the 
clouds.&nbsp; This city was referred to in the accompanying 
letterpress as a place of &ldquo;Rest and Peace,&rdquo; but 
inasmuch as the town was represented in the illustration as 
surrounded by a perfect mob of angels, each one blowing a trumpet
twice his own size, and obviously blowing it for all he was 
worth, a certain confusion of ideas would seem to have crept into
the allegory.</p>
<p>The other path&mdash;the &ldquo;broad way&rdquo;&mdash;which 
ended in what at first glance appeared to be a highly successful 
display of fireworks, started from the door of a tavern, and led 
past a Music Hall, on the steps of which stood a gentleman 
smoking a cigar.&nbsp; All the wicked people in this book smoked 
cigars&mdash;all except one young man who had killed his mother 
and died raving mad.&nbsp; He had gone astray on short pipes.</p>
<p>This made it uncomfortably clear to me which direction I had 
chosen, and I was greatly alarmed, until, on examining the 
picture more closely, I noticed, with much satisfaction, that 
about midway the two paths were connected by a handy little 
bridge, by the use of which it seemed feasible, starting on the 
one path and ending up on the other, to combine the practical 
advantages of both roads.&nbsp; From subsequent observation I 
have come to the conclusion that a good many people have made a 
note of that little bridge.</p>
<p>My own belief in the possibility of such convenient compromise
must, I fear, have led to an ethical relapse, for there recurs to
my mind a somewhat painful scene of a few months&rsquo; later 
date, in which I am seeking to convince a singularly unresponsive
landed proprietor that my presence in his orchard is solely and 
entirely due to my having unfortunately lost my way.</p>
<p>It was not until I was nearly seventeen that the idea occurred
to me to visit a Music Hall again.&nbsp; Then, having regard to 
my double capacity of &ldquo;Man About Town&rdquo; and journalist
(for I had written a letter to <i>The Era</i>, complaining of the
way pit doors were made to open, and it had been inserted), I 
felt I had no longer any right to neglect acquaintanceship with 
so important a feature in the life of the people.&nbsp; 
Accordingly, one Saturday night, I wended my way to the 
&ldquo;Pav.&rdquo;; and there the first person that I ran against
was my uncle.&nbsp; He laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder, and 
asked me, in severe tones, what I was doing there.&nbsp; I felt 
this to be an awkward question, for it would have been useless 
trying to make him understand my real motives (one&rsquo;s own 
relations are never sympathetic), and I was somewhat nonplussed 
for an answer, until the reflection occurred to me: What was 
<i>he</i> doing there?&nbsp; This riddle I, in my turn, 
propounded to him, with the result that we entered into treaty, 
by the terms of which it was agreed that no future reference 
should be made to the meeting by either of us&mdash;especially 
not in the presence of my aunt&mdash;and the compact was ratified
according to the usual custom, my uncle paying the necessary 
expenses.</p>
<p>In those days, we sat, some four or six of us, round a little 
table, on which were placed our drinks.&nbsp; Now we have to 
balance them upon a narrow ledge; and ladies, as they pass, dip 
the ends of their cloaks into them, and gentlemen stir them up 
for us with the ferrules of their umbrellas, or else sweep them 
off into our laps with their coat tails, saying as they do so, 
&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, in those days, there were 
&ldquo;chairmen&rdquo;&mdash;affable gentlemen, who would drink 
anything at anybody&rsquo;s expense, and drink any quantity of 
it, and never seem to get any fuller.&nbsp; I was introduced to a
Music Hall chairman once, and when I said to him, &ldquo;What is 
your drink?&rdquo; he took up the &ldquo;list of beverages&rdquo;
that lay before him, and, opening it, waved his hand lightly 
across its entire contents, from clarets, past champagnes and 
spirits, down to liqueurs.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my drink, my
boy,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; There was nothing narrow-minded or 
exclusive about his tastes.</p>
<p>It was the chairman&rsquo;s duty to introduce the 
artists.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he would 
shout, in a voice that united the musical characteristics of a 
foghorn and a steam saw, &ldquo;Miss &rsquo;Enerietta Montressor,
the popular serio-comic, will now happear.&rdquo;&nbsp; These 
announcements were invariably received with great applause by the
chairman himself, and generally with chilling indifference by the
rest of the audience.</p>
<p>It was also the privilege of the chairman to maintain order, 
and reprimand evil-doers.&nbsp; This he usually did very 
effectively, employing for the purpose language both fit and 
forcible.&nbsp; One chairman that I remember seemed, however, to 
be curiously deficient in the necessary qualities for this part 
of his duty.&nbsp; He was a mild and sleepy little man, and, 
unfortunately, he had to preside over an exceptionally rowdy 
audience at a small hall in the South-East district.&nbsp; On the
night that I was present, there occurred a great 
disturbance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joss Jessop, the Monarch of 
Mirth,&rdquo; a gentleman evidently high in local request was, 
for some reason or other, not forthcoming, and in his place the 
management proposed to offer a female performer on the zithern, 
one Signorina Ballatino.</p>
<p>The little chairman made the announcement in a nervous, 
deprecatory tone, as if he were rather ashamed of it 
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he 
began,&mdash;the poor are staunch sticklers for etiquette: I 
overheard a small child explaining to her mother one night in 
Three Colts Street, Limehouse, that she could not get into the 
house because there was a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; on the doorstep, 
drunk,&mdash;&ldquo;Signorina Ballatino, the 
world-renowned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a voice from the gallery requested to know what had 
become of &ldquo;Old Joss,&rdquo; and was greeted by loud cries 
of &ldquo;&rsquo;Ear, &rsquo;ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chairman, ignoring the interruption, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;the world-renowned performer on the 
zither&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the whoter?&rdquo; came in tones of plaintive 
inquiry from the back of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hon</i> the zither,&rdquo; retorted the chairman, 
waxing mildly indignant; he meant zithern, but he called it a 
zither.&nbsp; &ldquo;A hinstrument well-known to anybody as 
&rsquo;as &rsquo;ad any learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sally was received with much favour, and a gentleman who 
claimed to be acquainted with the family history of the 
interrupter begged the chairman to excuse that ill-bred person on
the ground that his mother used to get drunk with the twopence a 
week and never sent him to school.</p>
<p>Cheered by this breath of popularity, our little president 
endeavoured to complete his introduction of the Signorina.&nbsp; 
He again repeated that she was the world-renowned performer on 
the zithern; and, undeterred by the audible remark of a lady in 
the pit to the effect that she&rsquo;d &ldquo;never &rsquo;eard 
on &rsquo;er,&rdquo; added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will now, ladies and gentlemen, with your kind 
permission, give you examples of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow yer zither!&rdquo; here cried out the gentleman 
who had started the agitation; &ldquo;we want Joss 
Jessop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the signal for much cheering and shrill whistling, in
the midst of which a wag with a piping voice suggested as a 
reason for the favourite&rsquo;s non-appearance that he had not 
been paid his last week&rsquo;s salary.</p>
<p>A temporary lull occurred at this point; and the chairman, 
seizing the opportunity to complete his oft-impeded speech, 
suddenly remarked, &ldquo;songs of the Sunny South&rdquo;; and 
immediately sat down and began hammering upon the table.</p>
<p>Then Signora Ballatino, clothed in the costume of the Sunny 
South, where clothes are less essential than in these colder 
climes, skipped airily forward, and was most ungallantly greeted 
with a storm of groans and hisses.&nbsp; Her beloved instrument 
was unfeelingly alluded to as a pie-dish, and she was advised to 
take it back and get the penny on it.&nbsp; The chairman, 
addressed by his Christian name of &ldquo;Jimmee,&rdquo; was told
to lie down and let her sing him to sleep.&nbsp; Every time she 
attempted to start playing, shouts were raised for Joss.</p>
<p>At length the chairman, overcoming his evident disinclination 
to take any sort of hand whatever in the game, rose and gently 
hinted at the desirability of silence.&nbsp; The suggestion not 
meeting with any support, he proceeded to adopt sterner 
measures.&nbsp; He addressed himself personally to the ringleader
of the rioters, the man who had first championed the cause of the
absent Joss.&nbsp; This person was a brawny individual, who, 
judging from appearances, followed in his business hours the 
calling of a coalheaver.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the 
chairman, pointing a finger towards him, where he sat in the 
front row of the gallery; &ldquo;you, sir, in the flannel 
shirt.&nbsp; I can see you.&nbsp; Will you allow this lady to 
give her entertainment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he of the coalheaving profession, 
in stentorian tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said the little chairman, working 
himself up into a state suggestive of Jove about to launch a 
thunderbolt&mdash;&ldquo;then, sir, all I can say is that you are
no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a little too much, or rather a good deal too little, 
for the Signora Ballatino.&nbsp; She had hitherto been standing 
in a meek attitude of pathetic appeal, wearing a fixed smile of 
ineffable sweetness but she evidently felt that she could go a 
bit farther than that herself, even if she was a lady.&nbsp; 
Calling the chairman &ldquo;an old messer,&rdquo; and telling him
for Gawd&rsquo;s sake to shut up if that was all he could do for 
his living, she came down to the front, and took the case into 
her own hands.</p>
<p>She did not waste time on the rest of the audience.&nbsp; She 
went direct for that coalheaver, and thereupon ensued a slanging 
match the memory of which sends a trill of admiration through me 
even to this day.&nbsp; It was a battle worthy of the gods.&nbsp;
He was a heaver of coals, quick and ready beyond his kind.&nbsp; 
During many years sojourn East and South, in the course of many 
wanderings from Billingsgate to Limehouse Hole, from Petticoat 
Lane to Whitechapel Road; out of eel-pie shop and penny gaff; out
of tavern and street, and court and doss-house, he had gathered 
together slang words and terms and phrases, and they came back to
him now, and he stood up against her manfully.</p>
<p>But as well might the lamb stand up against the eagle, when 
the shadow of its wings falls across the green pastures, and the 
wind flies before its dark oncoming.&nbsp; At the end of two 
minutes he lay gasping, dazed, and speechless.</p>
<p>Then she began.</p>
<p>She announced her intention of &ldquo;wiping down the 
bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;all&rdquo; with him, and making it 
respectable; and, metaphorically speaking, that is what she 
did.&nbsp; Her tongue hit him between the eyes, and knocked him 
down and trampled on him.&nbsp; It curled round and round him 
like a whip, and then it uncurled and wound the other way.&nbsp; 
It seized him by the scruff of his neck, and tossed him up into 
the air, and caught him as he descended, and flung him to the 
ground, and rolled him on it.&nbsp; It played around him like 
forked lightning, and blinded him.&nbsp; It danced and shrieked 
about him like a host of whirling fiends, and he tried to 
remember a prayer, and could not.&nbsp; It touched him lightly on
the sole of his foot and the crown of his head, and his hair 
stood up straight, and his limbs grew stiff.&nbsp; The people 
sitting near him drew away, not feeling it safe to be near, and 
left him alone, surrounded by space, and language.</p>
<p>It was the most artistic piece of work of its kind that I have
ever heard.&nbsp; Every phrase she flung at him seemed to have 
been woven on purpose to entangle him and to embrace in its 
choking folds his people and his gods, to strangle with its 
threads his every hope, ambition, and belief.&nbsp; Each term she
put upon him clung to him like a garment, and fitted him without 
a crease.&nbsp; The last name that she called him one felt to be,
until one heard the next, the one name that he ought to have been
christened by.</p>
<p>For five and three-quarter minutes by the clock she spoke, and
never for one instant did she pause or falter; and in the whole 
of that onslaught there was only one weak spot.</p>
<p>That was when she offered to make a better man than he was out
of a Guy Fawkes and a lump of coal.&nbsp; You felt that one lump 
of coal would not have been sufficient.</p>
<p>At the end, she gathered herself together for one supreme 
effort, and hurled at him an insult so bitter with scorn so sharp
with insight into his career and character, so heavy with 
prophetic curse, that strong men drew and held their breath while
it passed over them, and women hid their faces and shivered.</p>
<p>Then she folded her arms, and stood silent; and the house, 
from floor to ceiling, rose and cheered her until there was no 
more breath left in its lungs.</p>
<p>In that one night she stepped from oblivion into 
success.&nbsp; She is now a famous &ldquo;artiste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she does not call herself Signora Ballatino, and she does 
not play upon the zithern.&nbsp; Her name has a homelier sound, 
and her speciality is the delineation of coster character.</p>
<h2>SILHOUETTES.</h2>
<p>I fear I must be of a somewhat gruesome turn of mind.&nbsp; My
sympathies are always with the melancholy side of life and 
nature.&nbsp; I love the chill October days, when the brown 
leaves lie thick and sodden underneath your feet, and a low sound
as of stifled sobbing is heard in the damp woods&mdash;the 
evenings in late autumn time, when the white mist creeps across 
the fields, making it seem as though old Earth, feeling the night
air cold to its poor bones, were drawing ghostly bedclothes round
its withered limbs.&nbsp; I like the twilight of the long grey 
street, sad with the wailing cry of the distant muffin man.&nbsp;
One thinks of him, as, strangely mitred, he glides by through the
gloom, jangling his harsh bell, as the High Priest of the pale 
spirit of Indigestion, summoning the devout to come forth and 
worship.&nbsp; I find a sweetness in the aching dreariness of 
Sabbath afternoons in genteel suburbs&mdash;in the evil-laden 
desolateness of waste places by the river, when the yellow fog is
stealing inland across the ooze and mud, and the black tide 
gurgles softly round worm-eaten piles.</p>
<p>I love the bleak moor, when the thin long line of the winding 
road lies white on the darkening heath, while overhead some 
belated bird, vexed with itself for being out so late, scurries 
across the dusky sky, screaming angrily.&nbsp; I love the lonely,
sullen lake, hidden away in mountain solitudes.&nbsp; I suppose 
it was my childhood&rsquo;s surroundings that instilled in me 
this affection for sombre hues.&nbsp; One of my earliest 
recollections is of a dreary marshland by the sea.&nbsp; By day, 
the water stood there in wide, shallow pools.&nbsp; But when one 
looked in the evening they were pools of blood that lay 
there.</p>
<p>It was a wild, dismal stretch of coast.&nbsp; One day, I found
myself there all alone&mdash;I forget how it came 
about&mdash;and, oh, how small I felt amid the sky and the sea 
and the sandhills!&nbsp; I ran, and ran, and ran, but I never 
seemed to move; and then I cried, and screamed, louder and 
louder, and the circling seagulls screamed back mockingly at 
me.&nbsp; It was an &ldquo;unken&rdquo; spot, as they say up 
North.</p>
<p>In the far back days of the building of the world, a long, 
high ridge of stones had been reared up by the sea, dividing the 
swampy grassland from the sand.&nbsp; Some of these 
stones&mdash;&ldquo;pebbles,&rdquo; so they called them round 
about&mdash;were as big as a man, and many as big as a fair-sized
house; and when the sea was angry&mdash;and very prone he was to 
anger by that lonely shore, and very quick to wrath; often have I
known him sink to sleep with a peaceful smile on his rippling 
waves, to wake in fierce fury before the night was spent&mdash;he
would snatch up giant handfuls of these pebbles and fling and 
toss them here and there, till the noise of their rolling and 
crashing could be heard by the watchers in the village afar 
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Nick&rsquo;s playing at marbles to-night,&rdquo; 
they would say to one another, pausing to listen.&nbsp; And then 
the women would close tight their doors, and try not to hear the 
sound.</p>
<p>Far out to sea, by where the muddy mouth of the river yawned 
wide, there rose ever a thin white line of surf, and underneath 
those crested waves there dwelt a very fearsome thing, called the
Bar.&nbsp; I grew to hate and be afraid of this mysterious Bar, 
for I heard it spoken of always with bated breath, and I knew 
that it was very cruel to fisher folk, and hurt them so sometimes
that they would cry whole days and nights together with the pain,
or would sit with white scared faces, rocking themselves to and 
fro.</p>
<p>Once when I was playing among the sandhills, there came by a 
tall, grey woman, bending beneath a load of driftwood.&nbsp; She 
paused when nearly opposite to me, and, facing seaward, fixed her
eyes upon the breaking surf above the Bar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, how I
hate the sight of your white teeth!&rdquo; she muttered; then 
turned and passed on.</p>
<p>Another morning, walking through the village, I heard a low 
wailing come from one of the cottages, while a little farther on 
a group of women were gathered in the roadway, talking.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;I thought the Bar was 
looking hungry last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, putting one and the other together, I concluded that the 
&ldquo;Bar&rdquo; must be an ogre, such as a body reads of in 
books, who lived in a coral castle deep below the river&rsquo;s 
mouth, and fed upon the fishermen as he caught them going down to
the sea or coming home.</p>
<p>From my bedroom window, on moonlight nights, I could watch the
silvery foam, marking the spot beneath where he lay hid; and I 
would stand on tip-toe, peering out, until at length I would come
to fancy I could see his hideous form floating below the 
waters.&nbsp; Then, as the little white-sailed boats stole by 
him, tremblingly, I used to tremble too, lest he should suddenly 
open his grim jaws and gulp them down; and when they had all 
safely reached the dark, soft sea beyond, I would steal back to 
the bedside, and pray to God to make the Bar good, so that he 
would give up eating the poor fishermen.</p>
<p>Another incident connected with that coast lives in my 
mind.&nbsp; It was the morning after a great storm&mdash;great 
even for that stormy coast&mdash;and the passion-worn waters were
still heaving with the memory of a fury that was dead.&nbsp; Old 
Nick had scattered his marbles far and wide, and there were rents
and fissures in the pebbly wall such as the oldest fisherman had 
never known before.&nbsp; Some of the hugest stones lay tossed a 
hundred yards away, and the waters had dug pits here and there 
along the ridge so deep that a tall man might stand in some of 
them, and yet his head not reach the level of the sand.</p>
<p>Round one of these holes a small crowd was pressing eagerly, 
while one man, standing in the hollow, was lifting the few 
remaining stones off something that lay there at the 
bottom.&nbsp; I pushed my way between the straggling legs of a 
big fisher lad, and peered over with the rest.&nbsp; A ray of 
sunlight streamed down into the pit, and the thing at the bottom 
gleamed white.&nbsp; Sprawling there among the black pebbles it 
looked like a huge spider.&nbsp; One by one the last stones were 
lifted away, and the thing was left bare, and then the crowd 
looked at one another and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how he got there,&rdquo; said a woman at length;
&ldquo;somebody must ha&rsquo; helped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some foreign chap, no doubt,&rdquo; said the man who 
had lifted off the stones; &ldquo;washed ashore and buried here 
by the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, six foot below the water-mark, wi&rsquo; all they
stones atop of him?&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no foreign chap,&rdquo; cried a grizzled 
old woman, pressing forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that 
that&rsquo;s aside him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one jumped down and took it from the stone where it lay 
glistening, and handed it up to her, and she clutched it in her 
skinny hand.&nbsp; It was a gold earring, such as fishermen 
sometimes wear.&nbsp; But this was a somewhat large one, and of 
rather unusual shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s young Abram Parsons, I tell &rsquo;ee, as 
lies down there,&rdquo; cried the old creature, wildly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I ought to know.&nbsp; I gave him the pair o&rsquo; these 
forty year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be only an idea of mine, born of after brooding upon 
the scene.&nbsp; I am inclined to think it must be so, for I was 
only a child at the time, and would hardly have noticed such a 
thing.&nbsp; But it seems to my remembrance that as the old crone
ceased, another woman in the crowd raised her eyes slowly, and 
fixed them on a withered, ancient man, who leant upon a stick, 
and that for a moment, unnoticed by the rest, these two stood 
looking strangely at each other.</p>
<p>From these sea-scented scenes, my memory travels to a weary 
land where dead ashes lie, and there is blackness&mdash;blackness
everywhere.&nbsp; Black rivers flow between black banks; black, 
stunted trees grow in black fields; black withered flowers by 
black wayside.&nbsp; Black roads lead from blackness past 
blackness to blackness; and along them trudge black, 
savage-looking men and women; and by them black, old-looking 
children play grim, unchildish games.</p>
<p>When the sun shines on this black land, it glitters black and 
hard; and when the rain falls a black mist rises towards heaven, 
like the hopeless prayer of a hopeless soul.</p>
<p>By night it is less dreary, for then the sky gleams with a 
lurid light, and out of the darkness the red flames leap, and 
high up in the air they gambol and writhe&mdash;the demon spawn 
of that evil land, they seem.</p>
<p>Visitors who came to our house would tell strange tales of 
this black land, and some of the stories I am inclined to think 
were true.&nbsp; One man said he saw a young bull-dog fly at a 
boy and pin him by the throat.&nbsp; The lad jumped about with 
much sprightliness, and tried to knock the dog away.&nbsp; 
Whereupon the boy&rsquo;s father rushed out of the house, hard 
by, and caught his son and heir roughly by the shoulder.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Keep still, thee young ---, can&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee!&rdquo; 
shouted the man angrily; &ldquo;let &rsquo;un taste 
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time, I heard a lady tell how she had visited a 
cottage during a strike, to find the baby, together with the 
other children, almost dying for want of food.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear,
dear me!&rdquo; she cried, taking the wee wizened mite from the 
mother&rsquo;s arms, &ldquo;but I sent you down a quart of milk, 
yesterday.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t the child had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer weer a little coom, thank &rsquo;ee kindly, 
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the father took upon himself to answer; 
&ldquo;but thee see it weer only just enow for the 
poops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We lived in a big lonely house on the edge of a wide 
common.&nbsp; One night, I remember, just as I was reluctantly 
preparing to climb into bed, there came a wild ringing at the 
gate, followed by a hoarse, shrieking cry, and then a frenzied 
shaking of the iron bars.</p>
<p>Then hurrying footsteps sounded through the house, and the 
swift opening and closing of doors; and I slipped back hastily 
into my knickerbockers and ran out.&nbsp; The women folk were 
gathered on the stairs, while my father stood in the hall, 
calling to them to be quiet.&nbsp; And still the wild ringing of 
the bell continued, and, above it, the hoarse, shrieking cry.</p>
<p>My father opened the door and went out, and we could hear him 
striding down the gravel path, and we clung to one another and 
waited.</p>
<p>After what seemed an endless time, we heard the heavy gate 
unbarred, and quickly clanged to, and footsteps returning on the 
gravel.&nbsp; Then the door opened again, and my father entered, 
and behind him a crouching figure that felt its way with its 
hands as it crept along, as a blind man might.&nbsp; The figure 
stood up when it reached the middle of the hall, and mopped its 
eyes with a dirty rag that it carried in its hand; after which it
held the rag over the umbrella-stand and wrung it out, as 
washerwomen wring out clothes, and the dark drippings fell into 
the tray with a dull, heavy splut.</p>
<p>My father whispered something to my mother, and she went out 
towards the back; and, in a little while, we heard the stamping 
of hoofs&mdash;the angry plunge of a spur-startled 
horse&mdash;the rhythmic throb of the long, straight gallop, 
dying away into the distance.</p>
<p>My mother returned and spoke some reassuring words to the 
servants.&nbsp; My father, having made fast the door and 
extinguished all but one or two of the lights, had gone into a 
small room on the right of the hall; the crouching figure, still 
mopping that moisture from its eyes, following him.&nbsp; We 
could hear them talking there in low tones, my father 
questioning, the other voice thick and interspersed with short 
panting grunts.</p>
<p>We on the stairs huddled closer together, and, in the 
darkness, I felt my mother&rsquo;s arm steal round me and 
encompass me, so that I was not afraid.&nbsp; Then we waited, 
while the silence round our frightened whispers thickened and 
grew heavy till the weight of it seemed to hurt us.</p>
<p>At length, out of its depths, there crept to our ears a faint 
murmur.&nbsp; It gathered strength like the sound of the oncoming
of a wave upon a stony shore, until it broke in a Babel of 
vehement voices just outside.&nbsp; After a few moments, the 
hubbub ceased, and there came a furious ringing&mdash;then angry 
shouts demanding admittance.</p>
<p>Some of the women began to cry.&nbsp; My father came out into 
the hall, closing the room door behind him, and ordered them to 
be quiet, so sternly that they were stunned into silence.&nbsp; 
The furious ringing was repeated; and, this time, threats mingled
among the hoarse shouts.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s arm tightened 
around me, and I could hear the beating of her heart.</p>
<p>The voices outside the gate sank into a low confused 
mumbling.&nbsp; Soon they died away altogether, and the silence 
flowed back.</p>
<p>My father turned up the hall lamp, and stood listening.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the back of the house, rose the noise of a 
great crashing, followed by oaths and savage laughter.</p>
<p>My father rushed forward, but was borne back; and, in an 
instant, the hall was full of grim, ferocious faces.&nbsp; My 
father, trembling a little (or else it was the shadow cast by the
flickering lamp), and with lips tight pressed, stood confronting 
them; while we women and children, too scared to even cry, shrank
back up the stairs.</p>
<p>What followed during the next few moments is, in my memory, 
only a confused tumult, above which my father&rsquo;s high, clear
tones rise every now and again, entreating, arguing, 
commanding.&nbsp; I see nothing distinctly until one of the 
grimmest of the faces thrusts itself before the others, and a 
voice which, like Aaron&rsquo;s rod, swallows up all its fellows,
says in deep, determined bass, &ldquo;Coom, we&rsquo;ve had enow 
chatter, master.&nbsp; Thee mun give &rsquo;un up, or thee mun 
get out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; way an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll search 
th&rsquo; house for oursel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a light flashed into my father&rsquo;s eyes that kindled 
something inside me, so that the fear went out of me, and I 
struggled to free myself from my mother&rsquo;s arm, for the 
desire stirred me to fling myself down upon the grimy faces 
below, and beat and stamp upon them with my fists.&nbsp; 
Springing across the hall, he snatched from the wall where it 
hung an ancient club, part of a trophy of old armour, and 
planting his back against the door through which they would have 
to pass, he shouted, &ldquo;Then be damned to you all, he&rsquo;s
in this room!&nbsp; Come and fetch him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I recollect that speech well.&nbsp; I puzzled over it, even 
at that time, excited though I was.&nbsp; I had always been told 
that only low, wicked people ever used the word 
&ldquo;damn,&rdquo; and I tried to reconcile things, and 
failed.)</p>
<p>The men drew back and muttered among themselves.&nbsp; It was 
an ugly-looking weapon, studded with iron spikes.&nbsp; My father
held it secured to his hand by a chain, and there was an ugly 
look about him also, now, that gave his face a strange likeness 
to the dark faces round him.</p>
<p>But my mother grew very white and cold, and underneath her 
breath she kept crying, &ldquo;Oh, will they never 
come&mdash;will they never come?&rdquo; and a cricket somewhere 
about the house began to chirp.</p>
<p>Then all at once, without a word, my mother flew down the 
stairs, and passed like a flash of light through the crowd of 
dusky figures.&nbsp; How she did it I could never understand, for
the two heavy bolts had both been drawn, but the next moment the 
door stood wide open; and a hum of voices, cheery with the 
anticipation of a period of perfect bliss, was borne in upon the 
cool night air.</p>
<p>My mother was always very quick of hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Again, I see a wild crowd of grim faces, and my 
father&rsquo;s, very pale, amongst them.&nbsp; But this time the 
faces are very many, and they come and go like faces in a 
dream.&nbsp; The ground beneath my feet is wet and sloppy, and a 
black rain is falling.&nbsp; There are women&rsquo;s faces in the
crowd, wild and haggard, and long skinny arms stretch out 
threateningly towards my father, and shrill, frenzied voices call
out curses on him.&nbsp; Boys&rsquo; faces also pass me in the 
grey light, and on some of them there is an impish grin.</p>
<p>I seem to be in everybody&rsquo;s way; and to get out of it, I
crawl into a dark, draughty corner and crouch there among 
cinders.&nbsp; Around me, great engines fiercely strain and pant 
like living things fighting beyond their strength.&nbsp; Their 
gaunt arms whirl madly above me, and the ground rocks with their 
throbbing.&nbsp; Dark figures flit to and fro, pausing from time 
to time to wipe the black sweat from their faces.</p>
<p>The pale light fades, and the flame-lit night lies red upon 
the land.&nbsp; The flitting figures take strange shapes.&nbsp; I
hear the hissing of wheels, the furious clanking of iron chains, 
the hoarse shouting of many voices, the hurrying tread of many 
feet; and, through all, the wailing and weeping and cursing that 
never seem to cease.&nbsp; I drop into a restless sleep, and 
dream that I have broken a chapel window, stone-throwing, and 
have died and gone to hell.</p>
<p>At length, a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder, and I 
awake.&nbsp; The wild faces have vanished and all is silent now, 
and I wonder if the whole thing has been a dream.&nbsp; My father
lifts me into the dog-cart, and we drive home through the chill 
dawn.</p>
<p>My mother opens the door softly as we alight.&nbsp; She does 
not speak, only looks her question.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all 
over, Maggie,&rdquo; answers my father very quietly, as he takes 
off his coat and lays it across a chair; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got 
to begin the world afresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s arms steal up about his neck; and I, feeling
heavy with a trouble I do not understand, creep off to bed.</p>
<h2>THE LEASE OF THE &ldquo;CROSS KEYS.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This story is about a shop: many stories are.&nbsp; One Sunday
evening this Bishop had to preach a sermon at St. Paul&rsquo;s 
Cathedral.&nbsp; The occasion was a very special and important 
one, and every God-fearing newspaper in the kingdom sent its own 
special representative to report the proceedings.</p>
<p>Now, of the three reporters thus commissioned, one was a man 
of appearance so eminently respectable that no one would have 
thought of taking him for a journalist.&nbsp; People used to put 
him down for a County Councillor or an Archdeacon at the very 
least.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, however, he was a sinful man, 
with a passion for gin.&nbsp; He lived at Bow, and, on the 
Sabbath in question, he left his home at five o&rsquo;clock in 
the afternoon, and started to walk to the scene of his 
labours.&nbsp; The road from Bow to the City on a wet and chilly 
Sunday evening is a cheerless one; who can blame him if on his 
way he stopped once or twice to comfort himself with 
&ldquo;two&rdquo; of his favourite beverage?&nbsp; On reaching 
St. Paul&rsquo;s he found he had twenty minutes to 
spare&mdash;just time enough for one final 
&ldquo;nip.&rdquo;&nbsp; Half way down a narrow court leading out
of the Churchyard he found a quiet little hostelry, and, entering
the private bar, whispered insinuatingly across the counter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of gin hot, if you please, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice had the self-satisfied meekness of the successful 
ecclesiastic, his bearing suggested rectitude tempered by desire 
to avoid observation.&nbsp; The barmaid, impressed by his manner 
and appearance, drew the attention of the landlord to him.&nbsp; 
The landlord covertly took stock of so much of him as could be 
seen between his buttoned-up coat and his drawn-down hat, and 
wondered how so bland and innocent-looking a gentleman came to 
know of gin.</p>
<p>A landlord&rsquo;s duty, however, is not to wonder, but to 
serve.&nbsp; The gin was given to the man, and the man drank 
it.&nbsp; He liked it.&nbsp; It was good gin: he was a 
connoisseur, and he knew.&nbsp; Indeed, so good did it seem to 
him that he felt it would be a waste of opportunity not to have 
another twopen&rsquo;orth.&nbsp; Therefore he had a second 
&ldquo;go&rdquo;; maybe a third.&nbsp; Then he returned to the 
Cathedral, and sat himself down with his notebook on his knee and
waited.</p>
<p>As the service proceeded there stole over him that spirit of 
indifference to all earthly surroundings that religion and drink 
are alone able to bestow.&nbsp; He heard the good Bishop&rsquo;s 
text and wrote it down.&nbsp; Then he heard the Bishop&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;sixthly and lastly,&rdquo; and took that down, and looked 
at his notebook and wondered in a peaceful way what had become of
the &ldquo;firstly&rdquo; to &ldquo;fifthly&rdquo; 
inclusive.&nbsp; He sat there wondering until the people round 
him began to get up and move away, whereupon it struck him 
swiftly and suddenly that be had been asleep, and had thereby 
escaped the main body of the discourse.</p>
<p>What on earth was he to do?&nbsp; He was representing one of 
the leading religious papers.&nbsp; A full report of the sermon 
was wanted that very night.&nbsp; Seizing the robe of a passing 
wandsman, he tremulously inquired if the Bishop had yet left the 
Cathedral.&nbsp; The wandsman answered that he had not, but that 
he was just on the point of doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see him before he goes!&rdquo; exclaimed the 
reporter, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the wandsman.&nbsp; The
journalist grew frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a penitent sinner 
desires to speak with him about the sermon he has just 
delivered.&nbsp; To-morrow it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wandsman was touched; so was the Bishop.&nbsp; He said he 
would see the poor fellow.</p>
<p>As soon as the door was shut the man, with tears in his eyes, 
told the Bishop the truth&mdash;leaving out the gin.&nbsp; He 
said that he was a poor man, and not in good health, that he had 
been up half the night before, and had walked all the way from 
Bow that evening.&nbsp; He dwelt on the disastrous results to 
himself and his family should he fail to obtain a report of the 
sermon.&nbsp; The Bishop felt sorry for the man.&nbsp; Also, he 
was anxious that his sermon should be reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I trust it will be a warning to you against going
to sleep in church,&rdquo; he said, with an indulgent 
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Luckily, I have brought my notes with me, and
if you will promise to be very careful of them, and to bring them
back to me the first thing in the morning, I will lend them to 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, the Bishop opened and handed to the man a neat 
little black leather bag, inside which lay a neat little roll of 
manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take the bag to keep it in,&rdquo; added the 
Bishop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be sure and let me have them both back early
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter, when he examined the contents of the bag under a
lamp in the Cathedral vestibule, could hardly believe his good 
fortune.&nbsp; The careful Bishop&rsquo;s notes were so full and 
clear that for all practical purposes they were equal to a 
report.&nbsp; His work was already done.&nbsp; He felt so pleased
with himself that he determined to treat himself to another 
&ldquo;two&rdquo; of gin, and, with this intent, made his way 
across to the little &ldquo;public&rdquo; before-mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really excellent gin you sell here,&rdquo; 
he said to the barmaid when he had finished; &ldquo;I think, my 
dear, I&rsquo;ll have just one more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eleven the landlord gently but firmly insisted on his 
leaving, and he went, assisted, as far as the end of the court, 
by the potboy.&nbsp; After he was gone, the landlord noticed a 
neat little black bag on the seat where he had been lying.&nbsp; 
Examining it closely, he discovered a brass plate between the 
handles, and upon the brass plate were engraved the owner&rsquo;s
name and title.&nbsp; Opening the bag, the landlord saw a neat 
little roll of manuscript, and across a corner of the manuscript 
was written the Bishop&rsquo;s name and address.</p>
<p>The landlord blew a long, low whistle, and stood with his 
round eyes wide open gazing down at the open bag.&nbsp; Then he 
put on his hat and coat, and taking the bag, went out down the 
court, chuckling hugely as he walked.&nbsp; He went straight to 
the house of the Resident Canon and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. ---,&rdquo; he said to the servant, 
&ldquo;that I must see him to-night.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t 
disturb him at this late hour if it wasn&rsquo;t something very 
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord was ushered up.&nbsp; Closing the door softly 
behind him, he coughed deferentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Peters&rdquo; (I will call him 
&ldquo;Peters&rdquo;), said the Canon, &ldquo;what is 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Peters, slowly and 
deliberately, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about that there lease o&rsquo; 
mine.&nbsp; I do hope you gentlemen will see your way to 
makin&rsquo; it twenty-one year instead o&rsquo; 
fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless the man!&rdquo; cried the Canon, jumping up 
indignantly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ve come
to me at eleven o&rsquo;clock on a Sunday night to talk about 
your lease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not entirely, sir,&rdquo; answered Peters, 
unabashed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another little thing I wished to 
speak to you about, and that&rsquo;s this&rdquo;&mdash;saying 
which, he laid the Bishop&rsquo;s bag before the Canon and told 
his story.</p>
<p>The Canon looked at Mr. Peters, and Mr. Peters looked at the 
Canon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some mistake,&rdquo; said the Canon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake,&rdquo; said the 
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had my suspicions when I first clapped 
eyes on him.&nbsp; I seed he wasn&rsquo;t our usual sort, and I 
seed how he tried to hide his face.&nbsp; If he weren&rsquo;t the
Bishop, then I don&rsquo;t know a Bishop when I sees one, 
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Besides, there&rsquo;s his bag, and 
there&rsquo;s his sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Peters folded his arms and waited.&nbsp; The Canon 
pondered.&nbsp; Such things had been known to happen before in 
Church history.&nbsp; Why not again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does any one know of this besides yourself?&rdquo; 
asked the Canon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a livin&rsquo; soul,&rdquo; replied Mr. Peters, 
&ldquo;as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I think, Mr. Peters,&rdquo; said the 
Canon, &ldquo;that we may be able to extend your lease to 
twenty-one years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord, and 
departed.&nbsp; Next morning the Canon waited on the Bishop and 
laid the bag before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Bishop cheerfully, 
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s sent it back by you, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has, sir,&rdquo; replied the Canon; &ldquo;and 
thankful I am that it was to me he brought it.&nbsp; It is 
right,&rdquo; continued the Canon, &ldquo;that I should inform 
your lordship that I am aware of the circumstances under which it
left your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canon&rsquo;s eye was severe, and the Bishop laughed 
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it wasn&rsquo;t quite the thing for me to 
do,&rdquo; he answered apologetically; &ldquo;but there, 
all&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; and the Bishop 
laughed.</p>
<p>This stung the Canon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he 
exclaimed, with a burst of fervour, &ldquo;in Heaven&rsquo;s 
name&mdash;for the sake of our Church, let me entreat&mdash;let 
me pray you never to let such a thing occur again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop turned upon him angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a fuss you make about a little thing!&rdquo; 
he cried; then, seeing the look of agony upon the other&rsquo;s 
face, he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get that bag?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord of the Cross Keys brought it me,&rdquo; 
answered the Canon; &ldquo;you left it there last 
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop gave a gasp, and sat down heavily.&nbsp; When he 
recovered his breath, he told the Canon the real history of the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
